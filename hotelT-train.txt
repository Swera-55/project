ID-0975	I mistakenly thought that since my multiple stays at other Marriott locations were excellent and clean that this location would be as well. Man was I wrong. This place is terrible. The room was very dirty and there were dead bugs everywhere. The room smelled horrible. I couldn't get the room windows open enough to help remove the smell. It took a while to find this place with all the construction in the area and the awkward road design in the area. I will never stay here again!
ID-0819	We got stuck in Orlando Florida and the airline put us up in a Best Western. By the time we got to the hotel it was 2am, we were tired and cranky, and the male receptionist had sharpened his teeth and finger nails into a point -- very creepy. We we got to the room it appeared to not have been cleaned at all. The carpet was wet from the air conditioner to the front of the nearest bed, the lamp shades were bent/faded and there were used test strips on the desk -- looked like it was missed simply because the test strip was the same color of the desk. I took pictures and intended on e-mailing them and a complaint to the corporate office, but never got around to it. To make matters worse, we put the do not disturb sign on the door and the hotel staff knocked on the door at 9am, 10am and 11am wanting to clean the room --- our check out time wasn't until noon. I opened the door and gave a scolding look and said they were too late for cleaning.
ID-1027	The rooms were small, the size or a jail cell or so. Televisions were small and dated. Outside of the motel was not pleasant, very dirty with garbage everywhere. The microwaves were dirty inside when I made a quick snack at night. Also the owner was quite questionable, as we're the other residents. Very run down motel.. My husband and I also woke up in the middle of the night itching, we pulled up the sheets and found bed bugs. We' then packed our stuff and left. I would NEVER EVER recommend anybody stay at this motel. When we approached the owners about the bugs, all they said was  we know, we are trying to get rid of them. They shoud be reported to the health inspector.
ID-0843	This Hotel is filthy, bedbugs, dirt, mold, the bedding looked dirty. There is only one person that runs the front desk and he is old and does not speak english. I could not get a refund for my stay and I wanted to get out of this place as soon as I walked into the room. There are obvious drug users and other illegal activity on the premises. I would never stay here again. The front desk operator is rude and the place is not worth what I paid for it. If I wanted to pay for bedbugs and filth I wouldnt have had a problem with the place. They alley would have been cleaner and probably safer. STAY AWAY!!!!
ID-0825	We stayed at the sandcastle resort/hotel in virginia beach for three days. Our experience was less than enjoyable. To start off when we arrived to check in, they could not find our reservation and the staff that was working there was extremely rude. They were confident that there was no reservation under our name so i went through my emails and showed them the one i received from them almost a month earlier. Finally after about 20 minutes we received our keys and headed to our room. When we got to our floor they were doing construction in our hallway and being very noisy. I went back to the front desk and requested that we be moved to another floor where there was no construction going on. they advised me they had no other rooms available but assured us that the construction would be done before 4pm. After going back to our room we found the room very dirty and run down. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and there were a lot of stains in the carpet. At this pint i decided not to make a big deal out of it until after we came back from dinner. We returned to the hotel just after 7pm and they were still doing construction on our floor. I wouldnt have minded the construction if it wasn't for the fact that they were very loud and drilling and cutting things with saws. I returned to the front desk again and requested to speak to a manager. After waiting for almost 15 minutes the manager finally arrived. We asked to be moved to a different room again and the manager finally agreed to move us to a suite for the same price we paid for our room. When we got to our room we found that is hasn't even been cleaned yet. The bed sheets were on the floor and there was trash everywhere. Apparently house keeping hasn't cleaned the room yet even though by now it was almost 8pm. At this point i was pretty upset and started to call surrounding hotels. we finally found another hotel that had a room available about a mile down the street. We went back to the front desk and spoke to the manager again. We requested a refund and the manager oked it. This was the worst experience ive ever had at any hotel, and to find out they still haven't refunded or 3 days to my credit card. I've been on the phone several times but have yet to hear back from the manager about the refund. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and am very unhappy with the way we were treated.
ID-0973	Hotel prices were below others of similar ratings in the area. This should have been my warning. Not knowing the area, I later found that the hotel was situated in the tenerloin district of San Francisco. The rooms were small and poorly designed, the hotel had no amenities, and local calls cost to make. A poor choice all the way around.
ID-0855	The Super 8 was one of the worst properties that I have ever stayed at, it was dirty, out of dated and the staff was rude.   The carpeting in my room was ripped and stained. In the bathroom the shower was moldy and the fixtures were chipped. The wifi was operating at just above phone dial-up speed. My TV didn't work at all.  This room was not worth the rack rate, or even 50% of the rack rate.
ID-1210	Went to this hotel when visiting nearby national parks with family. Front desk staff was courteous and quickly resolved any questions we had. Our 2-queen bed room was clean and spacious. Room has nice LCD TV, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, massaging shower heads, and good mattresses. We stayed for 2 nights and room was well cleaned and put together after first night with coffee packs refilled. Overall very satisfied.
ID-0913	The rooms were very old and dated. It looks like nothing has been replaced since the 70's or something. Our room had moldy patches on the carpet near the jacuzzi, and areas where the paint/wallpaper were rubbed off or peeling on the corners of the room. The room had a really weird smell to it as well. There was even trash in the garbage can when we checked into the room, so that was gross. And the housekeepers were loud in the morning and were swearing in the hallway. Definitely not worth our time or money. We won't be going back.
ID-1036	Over the holidays, we stayed at the Westin in St. Louis,MO. The hotel is stunning! It's located right across from the Cardinals Stadium. The hotel staff was very accommodating. We requested more towels at midnight and they were up there within minutes! The rooms were absolutely gorgeous. The beds were extremely comfortable. My daughter loved that there was a phone in the bathroom! Great experience overall.
ID-1262	Beautiful resort with excellent views of the ocean. The large pool with pool bar was an excellent place to chill and unwind with my wife while we glanced over the kids playing in the various parts of the pool. Extremely close to the beach, which had the right amount of people that you didn't feel alone, but certainly didn't feel cramped for space. Very nice, friendly staff that gave off the calm, Caribbean vibe. Couldn't of asked for a better resort.
ID-1162	This is a fantastic botique hotel in Portland, Oregon. All the rooms are suites and include a kitchenette. This hotel is great for small families because it allows you ample space and you have the kitchen included where you can prepare some meals in order to save on some food costs while on vacation. The best part is that there are piles of Starbursts candies throughout the hotel available for the taking!
ID-1021	This hotel is located at a busy traffic circle near the interstate. It isn't walking distance to downtown. The hotel restaurant was average. My wife complained about the quality of the sheets; they were pretty rough.
ID-1174	Headed up to Massachusetts for the New England Folk Festival in Mansfield. We booked in at the North Attleboro Super 8, since it was the closest place that had really reasonable rates. What a pleasant surprise to find an inn so clean, comfortable and well-appointed at this price level. The beds were firm, the room was roomy and the in-room fridge was a welcome convenience. In the mornings, we picked up bagels, butter, peanut butter, preserves, cereal, juice, milk and coffee from the free breakfast buffet in the lobby and took them back to the dining area in our room where we supplemented them with cheese, cucumbers and hardboiled eggs that we kept in the fridge. We were able to start each day with a hearty breakfast with no real expense of either time or money. You can be sure we’ll be back there again next year.
ID-0919	Do not stay at the Days Inn. First, when we got to the front counter and rang the bell, it took TEN minutes for someone to finally approach us. The young woman who did was more interested in her phone than in talking to us. Once we got our keycard we found our room and expected to at least have something average there. Wrong! The bedsheets and everything were everywhere. Also, there was trash in the cans and on the counter. The room also smelled like cigarette smoke. We will never be staying here again.
ID-0859	I was very displeased with my two-night stay at Doubletree in Savannah. It must have been off-season, because the hotel was nearly empty, and that apparently meant there wasn't enough staff to do anything. On Day Two of my stay, my room was still not cleaned by 12:30 p.m., which I found out after stopping back at the hotel to change clothes after spending the morning in town. I made a call to housekeeping at that time, then left the hotel to meet folks for lunch. When I returned about 3:00 p.m., my room was still not cleaned, and I had to call housekeeping again. I again left to walk through the historic district nearby. When I returned at 5:30, I again had to call housekeeping - this time I told them I would wait right there until someone finally came to time how long it took. About 15 minutes later, someone finally came to clean the room. Later that night - that maid had the audacity to knock at the door to ask for a bigger tip. When I checked out the next day, I tipped the valet - who came back a few minutes later on foot. She couldn't move my car because it's a standard transmission, she said, so I'd have to get it myself. She then gave me the keys and walked away - my original tip still in her hand.
ID-0917	Super 8 was a hotel I recently stayed at due to lack of other options. As far as hotels go, they were untidy, service was slow and the overall experience was horrible. The room I got has bed sheets strewn all over the place, and no room keeping person had bothered to clean the room after the previous person had left. The service was slow and it took an unreasonable amount of time to get a simple makeshift bed brought to our room. Overall, a horrible experience that was a waste of money.
ID-1015	I think I overpaid for a room at this hotel. Compared to the other hotels I have stayed at, which have only been a handful, for the price of the room I expected the quality of the room to be much better. $40 or so would have been acceptable for the state of the room. It was pretty bare and looked, well, cheap really. The sheets were thin and the tv was small, so paying almost $100 for the room seemed like too much. The continental breakfast items were also bland and it seemed like there wasn't much thought put into the food, just quickly made and delivered.
ID-1266	The Beachcomber Resort & Villas is what makes South Florida, South Florida. The moment I walked in I was taken back by the beautiful décor, and greeted by friendly staff. I was able to check in quickly, and with no hassle. The room was more amazing then expected! It had a BEAUTIFUL view! I looked out and saw ALL of Ft. Lauderdale on a crystal clear day. At this point, I decided I’d rather be on the beach then look at it, and no sooner then that I walked out the back door of the hotel, and was right on the beach. Beachcomber is amazing, the rooms, the service, the amenities all exceeded my very high expectations.
ID-0941	I stayed at this hotel when I was trekking across Pennsylvania to get to New York City the next day. I was extremely disappointed by my stay here! The staff ignored most of my questions and brushed those questions off of their shoulders like eh, it can wait. I was even more baffled with disgust when I entered my extremely stuffy room to find a TV that did not work, and a very low internet connection that I PAID to connect to! The meal was great though, room service was mediocre at best, and the bed was surprisingly very comfortable. This hotel was by far the worst I've ever stayed at, you can tell that these people were just in it for the money and had no people skills.
ID-0879	This hotel smelled like smoke everywhere, not just on the smoking floors. There was also a mix-up about our reservations before we arrived, they got it worked out but it involved some inconvenience for us. The breakfast selections were paltry, just a few sad pastries and some fruit, not the full, hot breakfast we were led to believe we would have. Overall, this hotel was not the worst but it was just disappointing in many ways. Next time I find myself in Grand Junction, Colorado I will choose to stay somewhere else!
ID-1274	Absolutely a great hotel for families! The rooms are spacious, restaraunts are very kid-friendly, and the pool area is gorgeous. My children felt like they were at a water park, not just another hotel. We will definitely return for another stay here!
ID-1146	We had an incredible stay at The XV Beacon. It started with an upgrade to a gorgeous room. The hotel is in a quaint part of Boston hand the rooms are on the smaller side. However, this is made up for with the service and the decor. The room is so luxurious and comfortable. The bed linens are the highest quality I have ever seen in a hotel. The bath products are amazing as well. Everywhere you look there are wonderful details. from bowls of fruit for the taking throughout the hotel to embossed leather walls in the elevator. The staff knew us by name each time we passed through the lobby and always went out of their way to be friendly towards our young daughter. The location can't be beat either. it's like staying with a friend in their brownstone in Beacon Hill. I would never stay anywhere else in Boston.
ID-0915	I was hoping to be able to spend my night somewhere nice for my birthday to get away but boy did I make a big mistake! The room was unclean and the beds unmade. When we went to the office to complain they did every little to apologize and made very little effort to fix the situation. Rude and unclean! I do not plan on returning during my next stay.
ID-1074	The Holiday Inn near the stadium in Philly was one of the highlights of my trip last summer. I was there for a weekend to take in the sights and watch a playoff game at the ballpark. The customer staff was very professional and even told me of a discount that I was eligible for, which I had no idea about, and it saved me almost $20 per night! The room was perfectly clean and the beds were just as comfortable as mine at home, so I slept soundly the entire time I was there. The WiFi was great and the restaurant was even better the couple of times that I ate there. All in all, it was a very pleasent experience and I can't wait for my team to play in Philly again so I can revisit that Holiday Inn!
ID-1064	A night at the Hotel Roanoke is a charming experience and the perfect overnight getaway. there are many venues to experience from enjoying a quality gourmet meal in The regency room to enjoy the luxury of late night drinks in the Pine Room, complimentary big cookies waiting for us in our room. A walkway connects the hotel with the downtown shops, restaurants and large farmer's market.  The opportunity of exploration are endless in this beautiful city, Roanoke it self being known as the festival city of Virginia always has something going on form the festival in the park to Dickens of a Christmas its a amazing place to visit
ID-0959	After a recent stay at the Luxor in Las Vegas, my husband and I have decided that we won't be going back or recommending the hotel. At check-in we were notified of a 15 dollar a day phone charge, we had no intention of using the phone but they told us this was a mandatory charge. We stayed in the pyramid and found it to be very outdated and kind of grubby. The hair dryer in the bathroom didn't work and it took over two hours and several phone calls to get a replacement. It was also noisy in this part of the hotel. The buffet was awful. We gave both breakfast and lunch a try. At breakfast, the coffee creamers on the table were spoiled. Gross.
ID-1246	The San Francisco Marriot at Union Square is an amazing hotel. I stayed there for three days during the summer of 2011. First of all the location of the hotel in Union Square is great because of all the shops and restaurants nearby and because of its proximity to many interesting San Francisco hot spots. When I entered the hotel I was greeted by the receptionist who had my reservation ready and who offered me many ideas as to what to do in the city whenever I left the hotel. My room was spectacular and had a nice big window in which I could see Union Square and all the commotion going on the street, which is nice when you're in a big city and can see all the city lights. The beds were nice and clean which is always a big concern of mine and the bathroom was equipped with many towels and toiletries, which was also really nice. There is absolutely nothing I can complain about seeing as the location, the hotel amenities, and my room were all wonderful. I would definitely stay there again.
ID-1046	This place is a piece of heaven on earth. As we drove up, we heard the sound of the ocean crashing against the rocks. The building was very open and inviting. The hotel staff greeted us with smiling faces, and offered to help immediately. The grounds to the hotel are well manicured and very lush. The rooms are luxurious. The beds, with their down comforters and fluffy pillows, provided the best rest. The soaps and lotions were heavenly. The lobby had nice areas to relax, and the beach access is as good as it gets. In addition, the pools are quite nice. There is even a slide for the kids and an outdoor bar for lounging and snacking, or drinks. The entire family enjoyed the stay.
ID-1160	Howard Johnson hotels are the best value for your money and your time. The staff there are very helpful and friendly, and the hotel itself is immaculate. Our family really loved the idea of bringing Fido on our vacation with us, and this hotel accommodated that for us. My children absolutely loved this place and everything about it. They were amazed at the sight of an indoor pool, and delighted when I told them they could go swimming. The hotel also had one of the best complimentary breakfast Ive had at a hotel. There was a huge selection of food. The rooms are big and spacious, so we had no problem fitting everyone in comfortably. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to get away, whether that be with or without family. One of the best hotel experiences of my life!
ID-1230	This hotel was absolutely beautiful as soon as I walked into the lobby. There are a lot of places to relax downstairs with lots of comfy chairs. The room had a great view of the town and it was a great place to relax. The bed was very soft and I had no trouble sleeping. There is a pool downstairs if you want to enjoy the weather, and the attached bar and restaurant are convenient.
ID-1194	My wife, two-year old son and I stayed at La Quinta Inn in Garland, Texas during our vacation this Spring Break. The staff was very nice and accomodating. They quickly brought up a crib for our son soon after we requested one. The room was clean and very spacious. Our bed was also comfortable. A great breakfast came free with the stay. They offered scrambled eggs, waffles, cereals, pastries, and much more. We had a great stay here. It only cost us about $80 a night.
ID-0883	My stay at the Jameson Inn in Lafayette, LA was absolutely horrible. The room was dirty and antiquated. The walls must have been paper thin as I heard every other guest in the entire building. Additionally, guests were venturing in at all hours of the night and I was unable to sleep at all due to the noise. The staff was not friendly and refused to address any of my complaints. I would never stay here again.
ID-1134	My husband and I were recently on a business trip to Seattle that coincided with his birthday; while he was working one day I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to celebrate by whisking him away to Victoria, British Columbia for the weekend. I booked a package deal which included ferry tickets, a champagne brunch, and two nights at the famed Fairmont Empress hotel.  I kept our hotel location a secret from my husband until we arrived, and I'm so glad I did! After we docked and cleared customs and emerged into the brisk air, we rounded a corner, and got our first look at the majestic old building. It honestly looked like a storybook castle with its pitched gables, gothic Victorian architecture and a fresh dusting of snow. We both audibly gasped.   Once inside, the front desk was busy with other guests from the ferry. My husband and I stood in line but took turns slipping away to poke around the warm, elegant lobby. It had fascinating objects like model steamships and faded photographs of royal and celebrity guests enjoying the hotel's various amenities over the years. We were therefore in a good mood when the customer in front of us threw what might politely be termed a tantrum. The young clerk handled the matter professionally and quickly. By the time she got to us she was incredibly apologetic. By the time we walked away from the desk, we not only had a seriously upgraded room (with a harbor view and free wi-fi) but a lovely written invitation to enjoy a complimentary birthday dessert in the Bengal Lounge! Amazing.  This hotel is wildly romantic in the snow; because of it we stayed largely inside, snuggled into impossibly comfortable sheets and pillows in our luxuriously appointed suite, sampling the abundance of delicious teas (the Empress is famous for their Afternoon Tea service) our room offered. We had breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the Empress Room, which featured heavy dark wood, intricate carvings and ornate candelabra hung amongst tapestries and paintings. We had delicious champagne and curry at night in the Bengal room, overseen by a full-sized tiger (skin, anyway).   This hotel was one of the few I've ever stayed in that I can actually say I was content to just spend time in; wandering various floors, exploring some fascinating history and relaxing in the refined yet comfortable ambiance.  A once in a lifetime stay!
ID-0869	We stayed at the Days in on 39th in Brooklyn for about 5 days in December. My daughter needed to find a place to live and register for school. This was the cheapest hotel we could find in Brooklyn. We thought it would be really bad but it was actually worse. There were bed bugs and we brought them home with us. eeeeeek! The staff were very helpful when we needed to get a cab. There was a free buffet breakfast. It was edible and the coffee was great. For the money it would have been fine but getting rid of the bed bugs was a nightmare.
ID-0829	I was in town for my friend’s wedding and stayed the weekend at this Days Inn. I have stayed in many Days Inn in the past, but this one was horrible. The room smelled like stale cigarettes and mildew. I had to buy some Lysol and spray it on every cover of the room and bed. I think something was biting in bed and when I pulled the sheet back. I saw dead insects under underneath the sheets I was laying on. The water ran slowly so it was hard to take a quick bath or brush my teeth. There were all kinds of huge spot on the carpet from old spills or leaks. When I complained to the front desk, he was not very helpful. The hotel was full and other hotels had no vacancies because it was “Bike Weekend”. I will never stay at this Days Inn again and will not recommend it to any of my friends. They have lost a customer for life.
ID-0939	After reading so many negative reviews of the Lafayette Hotel in San Diego, I felt like people must be just spoiled with modern hotel amenities and do not appreciate accommodations that are steeped in history. I was wrong. I am an optimist, and my positive thinking lasted all the way up the stairs and up to about 15 minutes after I got to the room. At first, the hotel lobby seemed dated and plain, but I felt that I could appreciate the character it had. Then we went up a staircase that was a little spooky, and finally, we got into our room. The carpet looked soiled, the bedspread seemed itchy, the bathroom was very dated, and the air conditioning was set into the window with a gap between the unit and the window itself. We had a child with us, and the windows came down so low, with no security gate or bars. The worst part was probably the lack of ventilation. It was summertime, and the air was stuffy in the room. Not at all the crisp, cool feel you look for during a summer getaway. We left the same day and found a room at the LaQuinta with a much better room and an even better rate.
ID-1202	Staying at the Bon Aire on St. Pete Beach is by far the best vacation experience I have ever had in my life. The landscaping is beautiful! I couldn't believe all of the different colored flowers and plants. Also the hotel rooms were great. Everything was kept very sanitary, and the layout of the room couldn't have been better. In my opinion, the greatest plus to have staying at the Bon Aire was being able to get food and drinks all day from Sandbar Bills. Sandbar Bills makes one of the greatest cheese burgers I have ever had in my life. Everything about this resort is just all around amazing, including the location. Right across the street from the resort is a Walgreens that is open 24/7! At night when Sandbar Bills is closed, I could walk across the street and buy a snack. In conclusion, I would recommend staying at the Bon Aire over any other place if you are coming to visit St. Pete Beach. You will not be disappointed!
ID-0839	We travel as a family to the Florida's Space Coast several times per year and stay in hotels for 3-4 days at a time. This year we visited Doubletree by Hilton in Melbourne FL during the holiday season. The hotel's website gave an appearance of being an upscale hotel on the beach. When we arrived the hotel was not what we expected. Parking was difficult. The hotel was under construction and we were constantly running into workers in the lobby and elevator. On our first night's stay I had to call the front desk several times because maintenance was still working on the room next to us after 9pm and there was constant hammering. The water for showers was lukewarm at best and the room was small for a suite. Also there was NO internet available for the hotel rooms so we had to go to the lobby every time we wanted to to a web search for restaurants, surf board rentals or other vacation necessities. The housekeeping staff ignored our request for clean towels even though we called the front desk several times and on the last day of our stay we were down to 1 hand towel for 4 people. I would never recommend this hotel because of the poor level of service and concern for the customer.
ID-1112	I stay at Great Wolf Lodge at least 3 times a year, its a great place to have fun with your family and friends. this place is amazing , It has a giant Indoor water park, with water slides and lazy river. The best part is you can go year round because the indoor water park is climate controlled. they have several activities for children to do year round, such as a wizard quest, and during the holidays they have a christmas play. these hotels are a great way to get a way from your everyday life for the weekend. access to the water park is included with your stay. If you get tired of swimming you can head down to the arcade and enjoy arcade games, and air hockey. This is vacation where you don't have to ever leave the hotel. for adults, you can enjoy their many restaurants and fine eating establishments.
ID-1234	The Kalahari is a great place to take your kids for a quick vacation. I went to the Kalahari a few months ago and had a blast. The whole hotel is rainforest themed, which creates a vacation feel, almost like Disney World. The indoor water park is phenomenal. Kids and adults alike will enjoy all of the entertainment that the Kalahari has.
ID-1182	I stayed here several times while visiting friends in Blaine. The staff are very friendly and everything you could ever need is actually within walking distance. Pizza Hut is next door, which is awesome! They also have free doughnuts every morning along with juice and coffee. The room I stayed in was very clean and smelled nice. I slept better there than at home. Even with the motorway practically across the street it was very quiet and peaceful. I'll definitely be back!
ID-1098	The Westin in Virginia Beach is by far my favorite hotel, which is why I keep going back. The fluffy white bedspreads and crisp white sheets will make you feel like royalty. The staff is very courteous and respectful, and the room service is prompt and delicious. I had to take pictures of my eggs benedict because it was plated so elegantly!! They offer a lobby bar and restaurant, a Starbucks, and a fitness center, with some bedrooms having fitness equipment in them. There are tons of restaurants and shops only a block away from the hotel! The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. The attention to detail is apparent- from the folded toilet paper to the elegant leaf-shaped soap! Everything is fresh, bright and shiny! I wish I could live at the Westin! You too will get the royal treatment here!
ID-0983	Upon check in at the hotel the front desk person was very rude, and attenitive in the least. The room was dirty, and the jaccuzi was filthy and out dated.
ID-0931	Stay away from this hotel!!! My fiance and I ended up staying at a Motel 6 on vacation due to their popularity and decent reputation, and especially for the fair pricing, however, this experience was something that was almost enough to ruin our entire trip. The room had no working air conditioner, and it was summer!!! No matter how many times we informed the front desk, they didn't send out maintenance. The sheets had yellow stains, and the entire room smelled awful. The shower head had terrible water pressure, but, this again was something that was never fixed. Eventually we just ended up leaving the hotel and paying double price for a hotel of the same caliber. Absolutely awful experience.
ID-0977	This is one of the worst places to stay. The hotel is next to railroad tracks, and the trains were running and blowing the horn day and night. When the train wasn't loud, the traffic on the busy street nearby was. The rooms were dirty and had some empty soda bottles in it. Our room was still not ready two hours after we were told it would be ready. We were so desperate to get in our room to change our clothes for a family reunion that we helped the maid make the bed. Do not stay here.
ID-1120	We stayed at The Oread in the Fall for a work conference and had a wonderful time. The staff greeted us as we entered and directed us to our rooms. The architecture is beautiful, with rock walls lining both the inside and outside of the establishment. It almost felt like we were in a castle. Our room was nice and clean and was well-appointed. There were granite counters and a comfortable bed. The pillows were so great that I actually asked to purchase one before we left, and they said since they get that request so often, I could order one to be shipped to my house. Overall, it was a great stay and I will stay there again when I am in the area.
ID-1228	I had a wonderful, relaxed stay at the Huntley Hotel. I wasn't staying in the priciest room, but all the staff treated me like I had reserved the penthouse. The desk clerk even helped me locate my wallet after I left it in the hotel restaurant. In addition to beautiful rooms and a kind staff, the Huntley boasts a location barely two blocks from the Santa Monica beach. When I wasn't enjoying the amenities of the hotel, I was lounging in the sun.
ID-1106	I took a trip to New York for a couple of days with my two daughters and we decided to splurge and stay at the Doubletree in Times Square. We booked a small suite on a mid level floor and were very excited by our room. The decor was exciting, bright colored and contemporary. Everything was comfortable and the bathroom was somewhat luxorious. We tried the exercize room too. It was quite nice and we were the only people in it. The reception area was stylish and appealing and the hotel staff were helpful and freindly. No one was snobby even though we were paying over $400 per night. We all had a great time at the Doubletree and felt welcome and comfortable.
ID-0823	Staff was very rude and unfriendly, made checking in to the hotel a pain. Breakfast in the mornings was cold and unenjoyable. Rooms were only mediocre.
ID-1258	I stayed at this hotel with my family last summer. A big plus for us was that they accepted pets so we were able to bring our dogs on vacation with us. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, and the rooms were neat and clean. We really liked the fact that there were separate areas for us to walk our dogs and for our child to play. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will most likely be staying there in the future.
ID-1017	I stayed at the Super 8 location in East Lansing, Michigan. It was cheap, but there's a good reason for that- the entire place is a wreck. The staircases up to the motel rooms were filthy, and some of the glass attached to the railing was broken. Once you got to the room, the carpets were discolored, and the room had a strange, pungent smell to it. I wouldn't stay there again.
ID-1116	This the best hotel for the money that I paid to stay there for a week last summer. Very decent breakfast and friendly staff. Internet was free and fast. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and looking forward to my next stay there this summer.
ID-0945	Well to start, there is mice the laundry room. The side balconies are very weak, made from debilitated wood that is almost 50 years old. The rooms are very drafty. The rooms come with television, that is choson by who is in the office at the time. They can change your programming right in the middle of your show! The rooms are badly painted, they are extremely little. They took the wifi extenders out, which makes internet very hard to get from this location. To be honest we HAVE to use the Ramadas internet to get internet connection. The whole back building is full of sex offenders. The sex offenders are made to work on the rest of the property throughout the day, which makes conditions for safety of kids very poor. That about does it.
ID-0897	I really wanted to like the Lemon tree Hotel. However- the king size bed was so hard, I didn't get any sleep for two nights (and I was 7 months pregnant at the time!). The futon in the kitchen/living room of our suite wasn't any better. When we told the front desk person, she looked irked.  The fan in the bathroom was so loud, that we ended up not turning the light on (light and fan were connected) when we used the toilet or showered. Speaking of lights, they were so oddly placed and the light switches were not near the lights that they operated.   The free breakfast was picked over by the time we got there at 8am both days, but they did restock the pastries and the coffee creamer (begrudgingly!), once they saw us standing there (or overheard us talking about going elsewhere).
ID-1102	The hotel was enjoyable because the price was reasonable and the service was quick.
ID-1025	I have stayed at The Inn At The Convention Center for a total of one week on separate occasions. First, if you can get past the curt responses of the near inhuman clerks in the front office, you will make your way into one of the worst hotel experiences of your life. Taking a trip in the elevator feels as if it will be your last. It is squeaky, smells strongly of cleaning detergents, and runs slowly. Once you arrive on your floor, the smell of cleaning agents is even stronger than the smell of the elevator. It buries itself into one's pores and haunts your entire stay. As for the location, it's true that the Inn At The Convention Center is near major freeways and minutes from downtown, but the area it's located in is terrible, offering nothing in the way of good food or culture. It is a haven for young party animals, noise included. Additionally, the wi-fi is terrible, if and when it works at all. You would be better off saving your money for a different hotel in a different location. You won't be sorry you did.
ID-1212	I've stayed at this hotel several times and always had a positive experience. The rooms are nicely furnished and in good condition, and always kept clean. Likewise, linens have always been clean and bathroom towels are plentiful. The water in the shower actually gets hot and stays that way (I've stayed in places where taking a shower is a risky experience!). On our most recent visit we ordered a cot for our daughter and were pleasantly surprised to receive a twin-sized roll-away bed that was just as comfortable as the regular beds--and without any extra cost.
ID-0971	Located in downtown Jefferson, Texas, this Victorian style hotel is sure to please. With the Lamanche's Italian Restaurant found right beside this historical hotel, one doesn't need to go far to find comfort of mind or body. Each room hosts a cable television and personal baths, and the bedding is comfortable. Each piece of furniture within the rooms is maintained very well to further the Victorian feel.  For any who are interested in the paranormal, and find themselves traveling to Jefferson for first hand accounts, they will find many a story of the odd visitations that others have had in certain rooms. Any who are less acceptable of paranormal activities can enjoy the calm and quiet of other well-decorated rooms.   With a friendly, personable staff to complete a pleasant stay, one can't veer wrong by visiting the Jefferson Hotel.
ID-0813	The Hotel was Horrible!!!! I mean it stank! I ordered a room with a Niagara Falls view, but I barely saw it. I guess the room itself was fine, but don't even get me started with the food. It was sick! I am a vegetarian and I prefer not to eat on the same plate as meat was served on, but they completely disrespected my beliefs!! You can make an obvious hint that bacon was served on it!!
ID-1224	Hampton Inn and Suites in Lakeland Florida was a great place to stay! We stayed for a Dance competition for my daughter who is 12. the staff was great, the rooms were all on the same floor and we even had a free hot breakfast! I loved this hotels location, it was in the middle of a shopping mall and the girls loved to go out there and walk around or go to the movies all while staying at the hotel A+ Location and service!
ID-1001	The hotel was pretty nice on the outside for the most part, but when we got to the hallway our room was on the wall paper was in the middle of being replaced so it was all torn down, the carpets were getting ripped up. If they were in the middle of renovations I wish they just put us in a different hallway, or at least given us a discount.
ID-1270	This hotel and resort is wonderful for family events. The three pools are an added bonus. There are many activities to enjoy year round.
ID-1248	My stay at the Rennaissance hotel in Ft. Lauderdale coincided with the wedding of a dear friend. My initial plans for a place to stay fell through and I had to book a room at the Rennaissance after arriving in the area. The booking staff on the phone was very helpful and the rates were great considering I was reserving for a stay that would begin that very night.  I was very happy with the amenities at the hotel. There is a more than ample parking lot. The lobby was fit for an art museum, and the food was scrumptious. The room we stayed in was beautiful and overlooked the pool and a lake. Our bed was very comfortable and we slept like babies.   Overall the service at the Rennaissance was impeccable. The concierge was extremely helpful, polite, and responsive. If I ever need to be in the area again, I'll make this hotel my first choice.
ID-1226	I love staying at the La Quinta Inn everytime we travel! Their rooms are always clean, many have awesome pools, and we always are able to get a generous military discount (my husband is in the Army.) The first time we stayed, I was unaware of their military discount, and my husband wasn't with me. The clerk started to ring me up, and then noticed my husband's dog tags around my neck. She offered me the discount...that has stuck with me, because she didn't have to do that, but she went above and beyond for us. Also, the La Quinta almost always has rooms for large families available, which can be hard to find (we are a family of 6.) I would recomend them to anyone!
ID-1132	I thought that this hotel was great. The resort was huge, had many pools, and offered many dinning options. They also had a shuttle that would take you to all the different theme parks as well as many on sight activities to do everyday of the week. You could do paddle boats, play tennis and basketball, and play a round of mini-golf.
ID-0993	A family-oriented motel well off the beaten path. Most guest rooms are family units that can be separated into two sleeping areas - one with a queen bed, the other with two twins - by a tacky folding vinyl wall. Third floor accommodations feature wood-burning fireplaces with gas starters. All have ocean views and are equipped with direct-dial phones, mini-refrigerators, and coffee makers. Rooms are clean, but decor is minimal and desperately in need of refurbishing.
ID-0953	When I checked into the hotel, I was informed the elevator was not working. I had to truck up the stairs, with my luggage, by self. I was provided no help from the staff. The air conditioner was broken, which created a very stuffy room. When I took a shower, the stopper was stuck shut, so by the end of the shower, the water was almost overflowing.
ID-0847	I love San Francisco and any chance I get I love to take a trip there. The last time I chose to stay at The Argonaut as I had always heard good things about the hotel. Sadly, the good reviews were either grossly exaggerated or there has been some major changes to the way the hotel runs things lately. The hotel staff were rude, snobbish and always seemed to be busy with some other thing whenever I needed help. Given the price of the hotel, I expected five star service, but was treated like I was some duty and obligation they quickly wanted to get rid of. Overall, my experience at the hotel was so sub-par that I'll probably never return to the hotel, no matter how great a location on Fisherman's Wharf it is.
ID-1232	i recently visited The W hotel in New Orleans(downtown)for the first time and it was best hotel ive ever been too. First of all, the hotel is beautiful!! The valet is prompt and courteous. I was even given a bottle of Voss water upon entrance...for free!! The check-in girl was polite and gave me a free room upgrade. My room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. later that night i ordered room service and the food was hot and fresh. i requested a wake up call the next morning and i did receive it on the dot.  Checkout was a breeze and so was retrieval of my vehicle. overall, i give this hotel two thumbs up!
ID-1200	When other hotels in the area were either fully booked or offering sky-high rates, the Extended Stay America in Burbank was a great option. There was ample parking, easy access to local freeways, and the room itself was clean and comfortable. The best part was the kitchen that carried all of the pans, dishes, and utensils we needed. It was right in a huge shopping center, which was very convenient.
ID-0827	Reminded me of a carnival  The hotel was nice enough, but it's just crawling with people. It reminded me of a carnival--swarming with people everywhere like ants, and wherever you turn there's shops and shopkeepers trying to get you to spend money.   The hotel is surrounded by shops, and as if that's not enough, Ala Moana shopping center is close by (more crowds and shops)! We checked out the famous Diamond Head beach which is close by and it was also just crowded with tourists.  I felt so far removed from the actual natural beauty and charm of Hawaii and couldn't wait to get out of there! I ended up staying at a quiet B&B in Kailua instead--much more peaceful and beautiful.
ID-0889	This hotel was one of the worst I have ever stayed in! When we arrived, the sheets were stained and smelled unclean. The bathroom had not been touched. There was no toilet paper or complimentary shampoos. The television did not even work. When we called the front, it took two hours for someone to come up and turn our room over. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!
ID-0875	Although it was very cheap, this hotel still wasn't worth the money. The sink didn't work, there was no toilet paper, and the room was in dire need of repair. Dents and stains on the wall were unsightly and even with all the locks on the door, the people standing around all day outside my room made me feel uneasy. I would not recommend this hotel.
ID-1066	This hotel was a very nice and affordable stay. The beds were comfortable and it had cable. The shower worked great, and the continental breakfast included a nice variety of foods. I would definitely stay here again.
ID-1244	I stayed in this hotel while I was on vacation. This is an amazing hotel. Lobby is huge and my kids really enjoyed the time we spent there. TV was big size and very crystal clear. Bed was clean and everything was very organized. Staff was very quick in responding to phone calls. I went to checkout the bar at night and to my surprise it was also very big and lot of options for beer. Overall great experience!
ID-1188	The first time visiting a city you've never been in is scary. Luckily, my friend booked me a place at embassy suites, and it wasn't so sad anymore. It has a great view from the 7th floor and the lights at night are fantastic. It's in walking distance from the North Point mall in Alpharetta, GA and I just about went there everyday. I practically spent all my money going to the mall and eating out everyday, but it was a fabulous time. The hotel itself has a beautiful interior and the one I stayed at had a free breakfast, an indoor pool and a bar. What more can you ask for? The staff at the hotel were very polite and accommodating and it was just a pleasant experience staying here. I would definitely choose this hotel again when I'm nearby and need a place to stay.
ID-1072	The Microtel in Charlotte, North Carolina is a nice place to stay. It is located just a short distance of the Charlotte-Douglas Airport. It is clean and inexpensive, a perfect combination for a traveler on a budget. I stayed there when visiting a NASCAR race in the area. The hotel was roomy, the hotel staff was friendly and informative, and I enjoyed relaxing there. The beds and pillows were soft. I enjoyed my stay there and would gladly stay there again. 4 out of 5 stars.
ID-0807	I stayed at the Adam's Mark Buffalo for an extended stay. While I was there I became very unsatisfied with the hotel as a whole. The maid and restaurant staff were not only unfriendly but at times down right rude. The hotel had bed bugs and leaking windows which ruined some of my belongings. The food, even a fruit salad would take over an half hour to arrive when you could see the staff sitting around and talking. I heard multiple rude or sexual comments from the staff. The carpets were dirty and smelled.
ID-0955	I picked this hotel because I thought the location looked good, and while it is not too far from downtown or South Congress, a car is required to get anywhere. No city buses come near this hotel that make it convenient to get to any desirable locations.   The hotel room was not very clean, and some objects in the room were damaged or broken. For example the toilet paper holder literally was barely attached to the wall.   Housekeeping did not replenish bathroom supplies. The bedding did not have a fresh feel or smell to it.   The continental breakfast was the worst I have ever seen, with only old cereal available and coffee.   The only good thing was that the price was low, however, I would recommend paying more for a different hotel.
ID-1124	The Ocean Creek Resort in Myrtle Beach is the Best!The Hotel is situated on the water in Myrtle Beach and has several pools for both adults and children. Because of the location near a creek the water is great for little children. The rooms are spacious and bright. the staff is very friendly and accommodating to your needs. The ocean side bar is perfect for sitting back and listening to music.
ID-1029	We recently stayed at the Country Inn and Suites in Mishawaka, IN. It seemed dark and had a musty smell. The indoor swimming pool had debris in it so we didn't even get to use it. The carpet also had stains. I would highly recommend staying at a different hotel in this area if you are looking for something that feels new and fresh.
ID-0933	The prices at this hotel are reasonably cheap, but that doesn't make up for the inconsistency of service here. The atmosphere of the hotel is not exactly what you would call ambiance as it is rather drab, dull and maybe even disheartening. In addition, it can get very noisy even at night, so that you might not be able to sleep despite being inside your room. For a decently priced hotel, they also charge shockingly high prices for food at their restaurant. Don't book this hotel, you can do better.
ID-1222	My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at The Flamingo Las Vegas. We very much enjoyed our experience there! The Flamingo is located at the center of the Strip and we were in short walking distance to tons of restaurants and other hotels. Our room had floor to ceiling windows with an AMAZING view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The room was updated with a very large flat screen TV in the living room and even a small TV in the bathroom mirror! Check-in was very quick and easy and all of the staff were extremely friendly. The hotel wasn't stuffy or uppity like other hotels we have been to on the Vegas Strip. The grounds were superbly kept and extremely peaceful at night.   We ate at the various places in the hotel several times and were pleased with each experience. Margaritaville had a great atmosphere and great service. We ordered room service for breakfast and the french toast was amazing!   My husband and I plan to return to Vegas this year and will be staying at the Flamingo again. You just can't beat the price and location!
ID-0907	My husband and I were moving from Colorado to Georgia and were using Super 8 motels almost exclusively because they had a policy of allowing dogs in the rooms. We reserved a room in St. Louis at the Super 8 and were dismayed to hear the manager tell us that he did not allow dogs in the rooms. This was in violation of Super 8 policy. I told the manager this so he said he could give us a room in a special area of the motel. The room he put us in was dirty with stains on the carpet and walls. We were so exhausted from travelling cross country that we took the substandard room so we could be sure our dogs would be safe. This was by far the worst Super 8 we had ever stayed at. The manager lied to us and violated Super 8 policy when the computer clearly indicated that dogs were welcome at this motel.
ID-1150	The Melia hotel in Atlanta was exceptionally nice. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. They have a nice bar and grill inside the hotel that was very lively. I enjoyed the overall atmosphere and it was walking distance to the Georgia Aquarium and the Coke building. The price was reasonable considering the location. My room rate including a great breakfast buffet. I was with my daughter visiting the Georgia Aquarium and considering I did not have to spend money on a taxi or buy breakfast, I figured I saved at least $50 each day or $100 total. I would stay again.
ID-1184	We went to Sycuan as a birthday trip for my husband. Even though the hotel and casino are seperate it was nice because it may the environment at the resort a lot more peaceful. When I made my reservation online, I ordered a dessert tray to be delivered to our room as a surpise for my husband. We were only in the room for 5 or 10 minutes when there was a knock on our door from room service delivering our treats. The dessert tray was amazing! We not only had chcoclate dipped strawberries and fresh baked cookies, but also a GIANT piece of triple chocolate cake. We almost didn't make it to the casino because we almost slipped into a food coma from all the sweets. What also made our stay really nice was the fact that they had free transportation to and from the casino. You could call from your room, and be picked up outside of your room to be driven to the casino. The bus runs 24 hours so it didn't matter if we went late at night or in the middle of the day. The drive is only 5 minutes and they drop you off right in front of the casino. After being in the casino we got picked up and driven back to our room. We had such a great night's sleep and there was no rush to check-out on time.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants the comfort of a resort with the entertainment of a casino. I will definately go back again.
ID-1082	This hotel is conveniently located just blocks from the world-famous Waikiki beach. The room price was very reasonable, and the hotel had a lot of great amenities, such as a pool, hot tub, bar, restaurant, and gift shop. The room was quite comfortable with a great view of the city, although I know that for a little more money nightly, the hotel also provides rooms that have an ocean view. The room was secure. It had a nice bathroom with a hair dryer. It also had a closet with hangers, and an ironing board and iron. There was a fairly large safe in the room where I could store important belongings while I was out, just for added security. There was a television, a refrigerator, and a coffee pot. There was also internet for a small daily fee. The hotel is not only located close to the beach, but also to a lot of shops and restaurants. It is right on the bus line, so it is very easy to just walk outside the hotel and catch a bus to virtually anywhere on the island, including the Manoa neighborhood, the zoo, or even to Hanauma Bay, which is about an hour's drive away from the Waikiki area. Furthermore, I really liked the hotel lobby--it is a nice open air lobby with tables to sit at and have breakfast. There is a lovely fountain and koi pond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a budget, but would like to experience Hawaii nonetheless.
ID-0921	The Dillon Inn is a nice hotel, but I have a couple of complaints. The rooms were pretty nice, but the water in the showers didn't get as hot as I would like. Also, the staff was not very friendly. When I called the front desk asking for a few extra pillows the front desk person was not very nice, and I had to walk down to get them myself. Other than the lack of hot water, and the somewhat unfriendly staff, the hotel is pretty nice.
ID-0989	In all my travels, Aston Waikiki Circle has to be one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at. Amidst the busy Waikiki Beach, the atmosphere was far from relaxing, although we were minutes away from all the ABC stores in every corner. The parking spaces were miniscule and the hotel needed a major remodel. The website photos were very deceiving because the room was so small and was in disrepair. We booked a penthouse and we got a cheap motel with dated furnitures and beddings. The only positive would have to be the view from the balcony overlooking Waikiki Beach and the amazing time I had with my husband.
ID-1060	This hotel was incredible. I stayed at the Holiday Inn in Binghamton, NY. The room was a perfect size, they had a mini fridge in the room which was a definite plus. The beds were comfortable and they even had soft and firm pillows! I would rate this 4/5. They were clean, and the staff was respectful. The services were perfect.
ID-1054	This hotel was very accommodating to our needs. It provided a comfortable queen sized bed and a pull-out couch for our daughter to sleep in. The continental breakfast was simple but just enough for our taste. It saved us the trouble of having to pay for breakfast somewhere else. The workout area was nice, as was the pool. Overall, we had a very good experience staying in this hotel.
ID-0911	Caesars Palace seemed like a natural stop for Vegas. It's somewhat iconic to the location. However, that's what I ended up not really liking about it. It seemed like they were far too focused on being iconic, and not enough on actually being a hotel. It just felt a bit too much like I was in a casino with beds, compared to an actual high quality hotel.
ID-0885	How can I not like sleeping in the happiest place on earth? We for one thing I didn't sleep, at all! The room looked great, with a big high bed and fun decor. But at night my husband and I realized the plush bed was just for show, it was very uncomfortable to lay on. The pillows were like the tiny little airline pillows. I needed 3 under my head just to feel comfortable.   We were also disappointed that the hot tub was not working. It was a brisk night and a hot tub dip sounded great, but the water was maybe only 80 degrees. The hot tub was really cute, decorated with the little mermaid.   Overall for $300 a night I expect a comfortable bed and a working pool area.
ID-0873	When we reserved a reservation at La Quinta Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, we expected a decent nights sleep at a fairly decent price. We have stayed at La Quinta before and were always satisfied. This particular hotel is not what we expected. It is run down and dirty in the rooms. Also the noise level was a constant all night with the parties going on in numerous rooms around ours. I wouldn't recommend this to my enemy!
ID-1052	I recently stayed at the Marriott Beachside Hotel in Key West, the one right off the roadway when you first get into town. It was pure luxury, and has its own private beach, with small boat rentals right there on the property. They have private cabana rentals and a poolside tiki bar. The restaurant is amazing and you can watch the chefs preparing everything right there from your table. It's a little ways from the main action in Key West, but they provide a free shuttle that runs every few minutes and drops you off right on the main strip, in front of the Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville restaurant. It's much quieter to stay off the main strip, and you don't have to worry about parking or driving if you've been partying. And who doesn't party when they go to Key West??
ID-0991	The Ste Marie Marie Antoinette Hotel, now renamed the Hotel Le Marais, is located in the heart of the popular French Quarter of New Orleans. Its location is convenient to the sights of the Quarter. Unfortunately that is the one positive aspect of this tired hotel. The property is in need of a renovation to the rooms and the common space. During my stay the pool was not operational, and the restaurant/bar was not open. The rooms were below average for similarly priced hotels in the French Quarter. The hotel's brochure featured photographs that were either heavily retouched, or taken when the property had seen much better times.
ID-0805	the hotel is very dirty and its not clean at all it has roaches there.
ID-1238	I've stayed at the 16th Street Mall Westin more than 60 nights in the past four years, on a combined business/personal trips. The staff and management of the hotel have always been friendly and guest driven in their service.   Love the hotel's location. In fact the reason I first stayed at the hotel is the fact it's on the 16th Street Mall and within walking distance of our corporate office. In fact after the first trip I stopped renting a car, there just was no need for one. The view of the mountains from the upper floors is breathtaking. The king sized bed has always been world class, as they are in every Westin I've stayed at.  The room comfort and staff friendliness are the reason I stay at this hotel every trip to Denver.
ID-0895	I hate that motel is cheap noisy very load barly change sheets, ppl tent to break into cars and they barly do anything bout it just sucks...
ID-1042	On a cross-country trip, hubby and I decided to stop overnight at this hotel. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the front desk and check-in was prompt and quick.  We went to our economy room and quickly found the bathroom facilities were not in working order. The front desk promptly upgraded our room for no charge (although there were many economy rooms still available). After a quick room change we went to check out the pool and hot tub area. The area was clean and well stocked with chairs and towels (and as a bonus, we were the only ones there). The pool was cool and clear, and the hot tup warm. After a quick dip we headed back to our room to enjoy the king size bed, huge flat screen TV, and premium cable. Our stay was very comfortable and no complaints about bed, bedding, or showering facilities.  The continental breakfast was superb. There was fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and make-your-own waffles. We left filling full, refreshed, and ready for the last leg of our trip. I would recommended this hotel for anyone looking for a nicer hotel on your weekend trip.
ID-0905	This hotel is your typical corporate facility, which is ok if you like that type of thing. Centrally located and clean and safe. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE WAS THE EXTRA FEES FOR INTERNET AND THE PRICES OF MEALS IN THE RESTAURANT, THEY WERE OUTRAGEOUS. THANKS, BLF.
ID-0821	This hotel was absolutely disgusting. The price is low but it is definitely not worth it. You are much better off paying more and staying in a hotel that doesn't make you leave feeling filthy. The towels were tiny and had strange stains on them. The tv did not work and the hotel staff were not helpful at all. The worst thing was that the bed stunk horribly. It really smelled like a dead body laid in the bed for a month and then they didn't change the sheets. I can't imagine how long those sheets must have been on that bed for them to stink as badly as they did. I would never, ever stay there again even if they paid me.
ID-1166	The Polynesian Resort Hotel is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. We had a fabulous time. We especially enjoyed the look and feel of the Polynesian. You feel like you're in the islands.   The service was terrific and the food at the restaurants was very good. There are also great shops inside for shopping.   It's convenient to the parks and you can go to the other hotels in the area.   I would definitely recommend it and we are going back really soon.  Keep up the good work!!!!
ID-0997	The desk clerk was very nice. However the rooms were not nice, they had baseboards missing off the walls the tub looked nasty, the toilet didnt flush right, we had to go ask for a plunger to get it to flush at one time. The fridge was iced over. The price was high for such bad rooms!
ID-1003	I would not recommend staying here to anyone. The rooms smelled like smoke, although it is a non smoking hotel. The beds seemed dirty and recently used without washing the sheets. We had to stay here because our car broke down and the mechanic was only a few blocks away and we were over 500 miles away from home. At night, it seems like a party hotel with people hanging around everywhere.
ID-0833	I attended a business meeting out of town, and my secretary booked me a room at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Modesto, California. This was the absolute worst hotel stay I have ever experienced! I travel often for business, and in all of my travels I have never been so disappointed with a stay at a hotel or motel. The clerks at the front desk were rude and unwelcoming upon checking into my room. Noisy children filled the hallways at all hours of the night, completely disrupting my sleep. Getting ready in the morning was a total nightmare, as no hot water flowed from my shower. To make matters worse, when I left a complaint in the suggestion box at the front desk, the manager never responded back to rectify the awful situation! Needless to say, I will never stay at this property again or recommend this hotel to anyone.
ID-0927	Overall, this hotel was not the greatest. The room was of decent quality, but was not nearly as clean as it should have been. The room service was terrible in that it did not properly stock the bathroom every day, creating a shortage of soap and clean towels. The complementary breakfast was good, but basic. The free wifi was very slow and unacceptable. The casino shuttle service was nice, however it was not on time. The gym was crowded and disorganized. Furthermore, the jacuzzi suites left much to be desired.
ID-0867	The management was unfriendly, the pool was a glorified bath tub, the smoke free hotel room smelled like a tobacco field, our electronic key card stopped working at 4 AM (we were returning from a wedding reception) and there was no one at the desk until 4:30. Imagine being drunk and tired and having to use the toilet and having to wait 30 minutes at 4 in the morning....No thank you.
ID-1180	I stayed here while attending a SHPE conference in Washington. The accommodations were very nice, the beds were comfortable, the walls were thick, the bathroom was of decent size - I absolutely loved the hotel. The staff was absolutely amazing and very hospitable- they went out of their way to make sure we felt welcome and enjoyed our stay during the event. One of my favorite parts of the hotel was the lobby, simply because it was large, but you couldn't get lost in it. There was always someone there to assist you with exceptional customer service skills. Everyone was very friendly during the stay.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and while some hesitate because of the price, it is really one of the best hotels to stay at in Washington in order to make the stay comfortable and positively memorable.
ID-0963	A couple of friends and my wife decided to take a one day short trip to the North Shore of Minnesota and at the end of teh day were so exhausted that we decided to stay in a hotel there rather than driving back to the Twin Cities. We stayed at the Grand Superior Lodge. Big disappointment. While they had rooms available, the hotel was so rustic the beds seemed old and were uncomfortable, and their restaurant closed at 8pm. In fact, all of the staff disappeared at around that time so we had to venture into town to find a place to eat. There were no amenities at the hotel and their only plus was the nice view of the lake they had. I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all.
ID-1044	The Southernmost Hotel in Key West is absolutely amazing. The location is beautiful, right on the beach with an extremely accessible and clean pool. The rooms were fully updated and featured a beautiful Key West/Island decor. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They answered all of our questions about Key West thoroughly and offered great recommendations. They even upgraded us to a nicer room upon arrival. The price was not exorbitant. The location was within walking distance to all the attractions on Duval.
ID-1005	I would never stay in the hotel again. The carpet looked and smelled as if it had been trampled on by a bunch of wet dogs. The microwave looked as if it hadn't been truly cleaned in months, not to mention the decor of the room looked as if it were chosen from a scene of an 80's movie. They claim to have free wifi but you have to call the front desk for a login code, well if no one answers at the front desk, this is pretty useless. The pictures on the website definitely overestimate the attractiveness of the indoor pool area.......the kiddie pool was the size of one of the baby pools that you buy for $10 at walmart. Needless to say, we were not impressed with the atmosphere. This may be a nice getaway for college kids that plan on being wasted the entire stay (this way the defects of the hotel woould not be apparent)!
ID-0949	THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!  Due to the fact the me and my husband did not pre-register to stay in a hotel during the State Finals weekend, we were forced to stay in the hotel. The first room we were given still had dirty towels in it. The service was horrible it took them 2 ENTIRE hours just to get us transferred to a new room. The WOST servicing experience of my life!
ID-1272	We love staying at the Hyatt! We have two little kids, so having an extra sitting room makes our time here so much more pleasant. The boys need to sleep earlier than we do, so we have the freedom here of putting them to bed without having to sit around in the dark waiting for them to fall asleep. We've stayed several times, and have yet to have a dirty room.
ID-1084	Recently I traveled to Phenix City, Alabama to visit my brother who is in the army and stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia. The trip was lengthy and by the time I arrived in Phenix City I was absolutely worn out. I decided to check in at the Quality Inn. I ended up staying there for three nights and enjoyed everything about it. They had the absolute best hot continental breakfast that I have ever had at a hotel and my suite was always clean and stocked with fresh blankets and towels. If I had the opportunity, I would definitely stay there again.
ID-1009	When we came into our room it had not been cleaned by housekeeping yet. We notified the front desk who moved us to another room. We reserved a non smoking room however the room smelled like old, stale smoke. It also had a musty odor as if there was mold or mildew somewhere. The furnishings were outdated and in poor condition. The lighting was poor which added to the drab appearance. The air conditioner was loud and leaked. The hotel was in a location that I did not feel safe in.
ID-0951	I booked at this hotel to save a few bucks but it was disgusting! Part of the hotel is facing a highway and I was given a room in this part on the corner of the hotel. It was so loud from trucks all night I couldn't sleep. There were drunk kids going to their rooms all hours of the morning! The hotel wasn't very clean at all. Not ever staying here ever again!
ID-0909	I booked a weekend at Terranea for my birthday. When I arrived my room was not ready at my check-in time and I was told I would have to wait. The front desk did not provide me an exact time but said I could walk around. An hour later it was still not ready. It took 5 hours actually. The next day at the pool a server came around and took my order while I laid out. They never returned. When I approached the pool bar it was mess. The sink was clogged and cups were everywhere. The price I paid made me really expect more. It should be a 2 star not 4.5. I won't be returning.
ID-1252	This was a really great hotel to stay at. It has a great location close to Lansing attractions including the Lansing Center, the Breslin, and downtown. In addition to the convenient location, it is also modern and updated and the hotel was clean throughout. The room was very comfortable and cleanliness was not an issue at all. The staff were friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast was a great bonus.
ID-1156	Our family of 4 recently stayed at the International Palms Resort in Cocoa Beach Florida. This is an excellent resort for families with young children. The rooms are accommodating with a large bed and a pullout couch. The kitchenette was also convenient because we could eat breakfast and lunch in our room and only had to buy one meal per day out. We also really liked the on site restaurant on the beach. It was close and the food was good. It also had an upper deck with a full view of the beach. The pool area is absolutely wonderful. There is a large pool for the adults and the children's pool has a pirate ship complete with water cannons and slides. Our stay was very enjoyable and we will be visiting again.
ID-1154	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Fairfield Inn and Suites in downtown Louisville, Kentucky a few weekends ago. The hotel was conveniently located right off I-65 and the hotel provided adequate parking. We arrived before check-in but our room was ready for us. Room decor is modern and colorful and I liked that the bath and lavatory were separate. The hotel was quiet and clean and the complimentary breakfast was one of the best I've had at a hotel -- fresh fruit, homemade waffles, bacon and eggs, etc, etc. Would definitely stay again if travelling to the area.
ID-0901	The Inn at El Gaucho in Seattle sounded like a great idea, being right above one of the most popular steak houses in the whole city, and located in the popular Belltown district downtown. However, the reality was far from great. The rooms were very sparse and the service was even more sparse. We waited for a long time just to get anyone to come to the front desk, and had to go downstairs to the busy steak house to find an attendant. The noise at night was deafening, with street sounds coming right through the walls all night, and music from the small movie theater underneath, which happened to be hosting a party that night. The prices were way to high for the level of comfort, which wasn't anything to write home about.
ID-1208	The Sheraton was divine. It had a trendy decor, great staff, and pleasant atmosphere. It was a bit pricey but it was also very worth it. I didn't have any issues with the staff. They were all very helpful and well trained. My room was like a gateway to heaven. The beds were soft, it was like sleeping on air. The bathroom was built with relaxation in mind. The dining was impeccable. The pool was another get away on its own. They even had a spa. This place exceeded all of my expectations. I couldn't have asked for a better stay.
ID-1268	The Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas is a great place to stay if you're looking for a place to unwind after a your wild nights in Vegas. Upon arriving the first thing you'll notice is there is plenty of easily accessible parking, that won't have you walking too far to get to your room. You'll enter and notice a large lobby with good abeyance and quick service. The food offered inside the hotel is great. The food court offers cuisine from all over the world, for cheap and affordable prices. The Indian food was AWESOME, quick and cheap compared to most of the prices you'll be looking at in Vegas. When I entered my room I was stunned by the size. For the $30 a night rate, I was not expecting a large comfortable room! The bathroom was more comfortable than being home. When do you ever get that? The staff at the Riviera was all sorts of friendly, even helping us find our way around the strip and letting us know some fun places to go that our 20 year old friends, and of-drinking-age friends could all have a blast. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm booking my room at the Riviera.
ID-0841	I stayed at the Quality Inn in Hinesville Ga, and did not like it. My first impression was they got to be joking. There is no quality in Quality Inn. Just old bed spreadings that were so thin that could see right through them. The corners of my room was dusty with crumbs and the bathroom was ruined with rust. The beds was not comfortable at all. I was not very happy with the room and will never go there again.
ID-1138	The Residence Inn Marriott was a fantastic hotel that I have stayed in many times. The staff is extremely friendly and always remember who I am since I travel quite often to this hotel.   The rooms are more than spacious as they boast a full kitchen, full sized couch, flat screen TV, a small dining table and a desk to do work on.   Also, a few nights a week they have free food and drinks on their first floor which is very delightful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
ID-1104	We stayed here this winter and absolutely LOVED our stay! The service was impeccable and the charm of the hotel was perfect. When we checked in, we were created with frosty glasses of water and were taken to a beautifully appointed guest room. We enjoyed riding bikes around the resort and looking at the beautiful ruins, as well as lounging by the pool with drinks for the fun cocktail bar. The food at each of the hotel restaurants was delicious! We could not have had a better stay and will definitely be returning!!
ID-1094	The Place Inn in Oxnard, CA is a perfect place to stay if you are traveling up the coast of California. The rates range form $25 to $40 a night. Each room has a microwave and a fridge so you can keep all the snacks you want right in your room. The twon of Oxnard is quiet and scenic so you can relax all of your vacation. Some of the rooms also have a large spa that you can relax in. The staff is helpful and room service is always on time.
ID-1011	I stayed at this days inn hotel for 5 days and bill was over $250.00 way to much for this uncomfortable stay. Located near the main street and highway so it was a lot of noise all day and night. Reminded me of an old motel. Smelled musty and molded. No swimming pool!
ID-1108	The Red Roof Inn was an excellent place to stay when i was needing to stay within a budget. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms had enough towels. The reservations clerk was professional. This hotel had a pool that was clean and well kept. The continental breakfast was good and fresh. There was plenty of parking. I felt safe staying there for the night and felt that i had enough privacy.
ID-0947	I stayed for business for 4 nights. I requested a non-smoking room, but when I arrived the room smelled horribly of smoke. They did not have any other rooms available. The Manger's special in the evening, which is suppose to be drinks and a snack was horrible. There was no snack to speak of and drinks were $7 each.
ID-1168	Hotel Penn is in a great location and at a cheap price. For less than most other hotels in NY, you get to stay in the heart of the city write across from Penn Station/MSG and a few blocks away from Times Square, Macy's, and many subway stops. The rooms aren't too small, and our room even had a view of the Empire State Building! The hotel is also surrounded by tons of cheap restaurants, and it is perfect for a tourist!
ID-1142	In 2010 my girlfriend and I decided to take a trip Puerto Rico as a reward to ourselves for graduating college. During the time, we were looking for vacation spots, we went on a website that offered great vacation packages. One of the packages included the Wyndham Rio Mar. My girlfrind and I immediately paid for this four night (air fair inclusive) trip. We originally did not know what to expect as the reviews for the hotel were good and bad. But this wasn't a deal breaker. Upon arrival to the Wyndham Rio Mar, we were impressed with the service, up-keep, and views from the hotel. The reviews certainly did not justice for the expereince we were about to have. The hotel was in an excellent location on th beach. We were within a mile of snorkling, horesback riding, and mountain climbing. We also wanted to travel into the city which they offered a shuttle and it was only a few miles away. The hotel also had four different restaurants within the hotle and a conference area. Overall the food was also great. The only drwaback was that is wasn't all-inclusive (Bummer). But all in all, this was an amazing experience.
ID-1128	This hotel is very affordable when my family takes trips to Lake Mead. You can find affordable rooms all year long and it is a very short drive to the lake and to the Hoover Dam. There is a gas station across the street and a casino, bar, buffet, and restaurant downstairs. They also have ice machines that are conveniently located, a game room for the kids and a decent sized pool and jacuzzi. They also have car spots that are ideal for those parking their cars with trailers. They have a small theatre where they show movies at a low price. The customer service is great. When we had an issue with a barking dog next door, we were bumped up to a mini suite in the small tower. It was great! I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Lake Mead.
ID-1078	I decided to stay at the Japan House Suites thinking that it would be just like any other motel and for the amazing rate I figured the rooms wouldn't be all that great. But, boy was I WRONG. The owners were very nice, helpful, and have AMAZING customer service. The rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable. And in the morning they make a made to order breakfast, which steak and eggs is one of the items on the menu. I couldn't believe this great hotel that i found especially for such a bargain!
ID-1013	I called weeks in advance to reserve a room, and informed the staff that I had a handicapped woman with me so I would need a wheelchair accessible room. When I arrived to the hotel I was shown to my room, which ended up NOT being handicap accessible. The handicap room was not available so I basically had to deal with what they gave me. On top of that, there were no towels in my room and the continental breakfast ended up only being frozen waffles. I will NOT be staying here again.
ID-1206	The Wynn hotel was one of the grandest hotels I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. The shopping is truly the best of all the hotels on the strip! The rooms were ample in size and very modern in the decor. It was five star all the way! My husband loved the sports book and said it was the best of all he has been to. He should know he has been coming to Vegas since the '72. The night life there was fantastic. Surrender is now one of my alltime fav clubs to go to. Let me mention the view was incredible from our rooms. The water falls were beautiful too! I LOVE THE WYNN
ID-0999	I had booked a one week stay at the St. Augustine Beachfront Resort but after the first night I left. To begin they gave me the key to a room filled with other people!!! Can you imagine that!!! Then they sent me to another room that the beds were not made and it was dirty. The third room the key did not work after a long drive the last thing I wanted to deal with was all these problems. We finally got into our room and it was very dirty, the carpets were black the wall paper was peeling, the shower had mildew and worst of all there roaches crawling on the walls. I have never felt so disgusted. When I walked out of the room there were rats crawling in the hallways. There is no beach access, so this is not a beachfront resort like they claim.The office staff is rude and very unprofessional, you can tell they don't care about there jobs at all. This a roach motel not a resort!!
ID-1033	My son and I made a spur of the moment decision to spend the weekend in Virginia Beach. We arrived and saw that the Palm Grove was on the ocean and had a vacancy. I was immediately annoyed when I had to pay for the room upfront. My experience only got worse. The interior is old and worn out- which I could have handles, except my room was also dirty. The floor had not been cleaned, the bed was messy, and there was popcorn in the sheets! Even worse, when I called the desk to change rooms, I was told I could not and after being treated rudely, someone came to clean the room an hour later. I should have left then and there. Needless to say we didn't stay a second night, and I'll never return again.
ID-0961	When I booked my stay, I was not informed that the entire third floor was under construction. We booked a business king room, which is normally on the first floor at other Red Roof Inns. Our room, however, was on the fourth floor. When I called guest services from my room to ask places that delivered food to the hotel, they only recommended the pizza company advertised on the room keys. After calling places myself, I was able to find a Mexican restaurant and Chinese restaurant that were not advertised by the hotel. The hotel boasts of having a 24-hour diner. Do not expect good service at this diner. They do not have fountain beverages and they do not pay attention to their tables. The heated pool advertised was dirty. The only thing good about this hotel is the free shuttle to the airport.
ID-1023	I really didn't like how cheap this motel was. It was somewhat shabby and not very nice sometimes to stay in the main building and was somewhat dark. The place didn't offer as much as I really wanted from a motel.
ID-0835	I went to Syracuse last winter to watch my team play in the Carrier Dome and chose this Econo Lodge because the prices were cheaper (because I found out later that it's in a pretty run-down part of town) and mainly cause most of the better hotels were already booked. I drove up there and arrived pretty late, so I was very tired and ready to get some sleep before the game the next day. After pulling into the small parking lot, I realized after driving around that all the Free Parking spaces were gone, so I had to drive down the street to a paid parking lot. Then, after carrying my luggage all the way to the hotel, I checked in and, in a sleepy haze, threw my stuff down in the room and went to sleep.  Not more than two hours later, I woke up from incredible itching on my arms and legs, so I quickly turned on the light and realized how awfully dirty my room was. Then I looked closer at my bed near the sheets and I literally could see many, if not hundreds, of tiny bedbugs crawling everywhere. I immediately ran to the desk, where no one was there of course, and after waiting for 30 minutes for someone to show up, I demanded another room. I then got the new room key, went up to it, and after opening the door, I saw that this new room was no more clean than the last. And yes, there were just as many bedbugs in this bed.   I grabbed my stuff and walked back to my car and slept there for the rest of the night. Needless to say, not only will I never visit this Econo Lodge again, I doubt I will ever even visit Syracuse again.
ID-1164	The Naples Grande Beach Resort by Waldorf Astoria is a fabulous hotel located in the pristine beaches of Florida's Gulf Coast. This wonderful property features an unparalleled location overlooking the ocean while sipping a drink from your room's balcony. Helpful staff and high standards of service and cleanliness make it a great place to relax for a few days. If you are traveling with your family, Naples Grande features many amenities for kids, including a very entertaining pool complete with water slides and water activities. A second pool is available for those who wish a more quiet atmosphere while still enjoying pool-side service.   Located just a few minutes from downtown Naples, you can always venture out for dinner in town, or for some shopping. However, if you just want to get away you can park your car and forget about it until it is time to venture back to reality! Everything you may need is available at this fabulous hotel!
ID-0893	This Red Roof Inn in North Charleston, South Carolina is pretty inexpensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. The location is terrible. It’s right off the interstate in a very busy, loud commercial area. It should also be noted that it’s not as close to the historic downtown and beach areas in Charleston as you might be lead to believe. We got there a little early and the room wasn’t ready, so we went to a nearby Starbucks for about an hour. We came back after check-in time, and the room still wasn’t ready. They lady at the desk was nice but incompetent. When we finally got into a room, it was what you’d expect from a cheap hotel, and it smelled of cigarettes and cheap cleaning products. I think the worst part of it all was the other clientele there. We had a room on the second floor, which required climbing two flights of stairs. Some very unsavory individuals were always hanging out on the stairs and the landing. It made me really uncomfortable to walk to and from my car. Next time, I’ll pay extra and stay somewhere else.
ID-1178	Once you book a room at the Baltimore Hyatt Regency Hotel, you will get an instant feeling of being right at home. The hotel staff greets all of it's customers with warm smiles and candy. The hotel staff, upon request, can give you a tour of the room that you plan to book. Once you are in your hotel room, the rooms are emmaculate. Overlooking the Inner Harbor and all of it's attractions. I was able to visit the attractions, have dinner in the hotel's dining room, and kick back and enjoy the room.
ID-0817	The hotel has very thin walls and ceiling so you can hear EVERYTHING. You can even hear full conversations word-for-word. Even when we complained to have someone tell the person above us to be quiet, the manager didn't do anything at all. There was a county fair going on with bus fulls of high school kids having a party right outside our door and were shooting off fireworks. However, no one told them to be quiet. All the manager told us was that we could leave (without a refund).
ID-0803	On my way home from a trip with my family, the drive was taking longer than expected, so we decided to stay in a hotel for the evening. It was summer, and there were few vacanies along highway 299, but we felt lucky to find an open spot in a motel, just as darkness was creeping up on us. Unfortunately, there were many obvious reasons for said vacancy. The walls were paper thin, and we could hear the people on the floor above us walk, talk, and urinate. When they turned the shower on, our ceiling suddenly became leaky. The room was small, and dirty, with strange decor. Also, there is a tiny, tacky cage in the parking lot, which claims to have housed Big Foot. Overall, it was a terrible experience.
ID-1096	This should definitely be one of your first choices for a place to stay on any trip to Montreal, but especially if you are visiting for pleasure. It offers a bargain price for elegant, comfortable accommodations and an authentically high-class experience - the staff is great and friendly, and will make you feel like (whether you are or not) a celebrity. Also, its downtown location is quite convenient. Overall, one of the best values you'll find.
ID-1092	I'm a frequent traveler to Japan, and of all the hotels I've stayed in, my favorite, by far, has been the Park Hotel Tokyo. The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.
ID-1062	This hotel was surprisingly well maintained and nice for the price. I found the room to be very clean and the bed was confortable. The wireless was lacking but data center in the lobby was such that I could work and not be distracted. I enjoyed the food in the restaurant and the bar. The staff was very pleasant and the night auditor was very helpful straightening out a problem with my bill. I'd defintely stay there again if I'm ever back in Dallas and would recommend to friends visiting the area.
ID-1264	I recently went to the Aulani Resort and Spa for a staycation for 3 days. Our party consisted of 3 females and 3 males all between the ages of 25 and 30 and we all found the hotel a great place to spend a few days to relax and be a kid again. We had breakfast with Hawaiian themed Disney characters such as Goofy, Mickey, and Minnie which was fun. Playing in the large pool and relaxing in the man-made creek was a great place to be. 3 in our party went to the spa and all came back relaxed and refreshed while my girlfriend, her friend and I went to play on the water slides and generally have a good time. The setting of the hotel is beautiful beside a salt water lagoon. The night before we left we had a delicious dinner at the Ama'ama restaurant. It was sad to get back to reality once we finished.
ID-0811	The Rio hotel is the absolute worst hotel I've stayed in on or just off the strip! It had the worst service! As we would stroll down the rundown hallways the smell of room service dishes and smoke was so dissapointing! The same left over food was left out for our two days stay. We could smell smoke in our rooms from the casino. My husband had trouble sleeping as the neon lights could be seen in our rooms with the curtains drawn. The casino was like an old bar room. Really bad ventilation! Last but not least! It took over sixty minutes to check out!
ID-1136	I was very impressed with the hotel. The exterior of the hotel was one thing, which is simply marvelous, but it was probably the roomiest hotel in the Concord, NH area. It is close to my brother's school, had excellent service and pretty nifty free toiletry, nice bathrooms, free internet connection and more. The attendants were very attentive, and I would love to stay there again if not for the price.
ID-1126	My stay at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Minneapolis, MN was an enjoyable experience that was enhanced by the many upscale benefits provided by the hotel. The highlight of these was the complimentary hot breakfast served in the morning. In addition to the normal breakfast components such as fresh fruit, cereal, assorted pastries, and the other usual suspects, Embassy Suits offers a cooked-to-order grill, where you can request pancakes, bacon, sausage, and their famous omelets. It was delicious!  The main reception area off of the lobby is gorgeous, with flowing water and plants creating a peaceful atmosphere that is a great place to sit down and relax, or chat with friends. I also appreciated the clean room (with comfy beds) that had both a sleeping area, and a separate living room space. Capping it all off, the hotel is right next to the Mall of America and 10 minute away from the Minneapolis airport.
ID-1204	This hotel was fantastic, everything about it was simply amazing. Not only that, but on my first attempt to find the place, my GPS took me to the wrong location (another Hyatt Place) and even THAT location was clean, and had nice attendants who promptly directed me to the other location.  The price and amenities are simply unbeatable. Due to extending my stay, I had to switch hotels, and let me say, this hotel offered twice the value at half the cost. When you enter, the room is split into multiple rooms, the TV is huge and HD, the WiFi is free, and the beds are so comfortable. Downstairs, they have a 24/7 desert bar, you simply walk down, tell them what you want, and they add it to your tab (they don't even ask for your room number, they remember it!). So convenient and amazing. When you show up, they even offer you a personalized tour!  And when you wake up, stop by the breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are to die for.
ID-0987	The Ao Chalong Hotel in Phuket, Thailand was a huge disappointment. We wanted to have a nice, somewhat luxury vacation, me and my two friends. We arrived at a later hour (but had informed the hotel that we would get in later because of our late flight) and the staff was extremely unfriendly. Since there were three of us traveling together it was difficult to find rooms that accommodated three people. However, when we booked with Ao Chalong we specifically stated that we would be three people and need a third bed. From the get go, the hotel had our reservation completely wrong and were extremely disrespectful to us. They made us very uncomfortable and the accommodations were terrible. We could hear everything from the other rooms and the locations were ugly and in terrible state. Stay away from this hotel.
ID-0929	When I visited this hotel, I thought everything was going to be great. It's appearance was not too shabby, but as soon as I got to the room, my opinion began to change. The room was nowhere near the quality that the rest of the hotel was; it only came with the basics, and nothing more. I would have expected more from a nicer hotel. The other surprising thing about this hotel was the staff. I did not feel secure at all. When I first came to my room to find my wife, she was not there (and I did not have a key). I simply came to the door, knocked, and waited one second. The maid down the hall came over and let me in the room. I could have been some stranger that was knocking on someone's room! I will not go back to that hotel because of this safety issue. Thank you.
ID-0801	We were visiting Salem and only stayed one night at this location. The room felt...and smelled dirty. It smelled like it had at one point been a smoking room that they were attempting to cover up and re-purpose as a non smoking room. The water in the hotel also had a funny taste and there were no alternatives to tap water provided that they were not charging a ridiculous amount for. All in all any mildly redeeming qualities did not make up for the sanitary levels of the room we stayed in.
ID-0923	The inclusion of insects in your hotel room isn't anything to be thrilled about. The motel 6 hotelier establishments typically have permissable conditions, however a particular experience of mind was quite atrocious. The room had a faint odor or must to it that denoted mold or mildew in the bathroom area. Also the maids or cleaning staff enter your room without knocking first, promptly apologizing however the damage has already been done. I do not appreciate people unlocking my door at a whim's notice and having complete unhindered access to my valuables which are extremely important. Documents such as my passport and my wallet were placed into the electrical safe only to find that the safe did NOT lock and opened with a universal key code of 00000. I will not be returning to this hotel if I can help it.
ID-1216	I have no complaints and I’m a picky hotel guest. The room was clean, the sheets were not old, and the bathroom was spotless. Everything worked properly which made for a great experience while getting ready for an interview. The front desk staff was more the helpful. They gave us advice on where to eat, information on the city, and the place I was interviewing at. The continental breakfast had lots of unique options; it went beyond the average spread at a hotel. I’m impressed.
ID-1088	Thsi is the mose beautiful place I have ever stayed. A very small 40 room French style hotel. The staff is exceptional and the beach is the best in all of Jamaica.  Very clean and the rooms are great. Clive the beach security is the best ever in keeping all the venodors away from you so you can relax
ID-1114	From the moment you walk in, you know the experience at the Westin is going to be a fantastic one. The staff behind the counter are friendly and the bellhop will take your bags to your room while you check in. Everyone is dressed nicely and act very professionally; something you expect from such a high quality hotel. The rooms are large with nice flat-screen televisions to watch while you're laying on a goose feather down comforter. The bathroom is equally as impressive with marble floors, a large back lit mirror and a walk in shower that has stone tile! The in house restaurant has a variety of delicious menu options to eat while you look out over the pool deck. Valet parking is available as well and can be called from your room so you don't have to wait! I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone seeking luxury and comfort during their stay.
ID-0871	This was our first and only stay at the Ambassador hotel in New Orleans. When arriving we had to wait for five minutes before anyone even asked us about checking in. We paid for a deluxe room only to find that the room did not have a window looking to the outside. I must point out I said a window looking to the outside as we did in fact have a window looking out into the hallway? Also it had flimsy blinds covering the window, hardly blocking anyone from looking right in at the bed. It was mid-may in New Orleans which means its already hotter than a firecracker on the fourth of July, the air conditioning would barely work even after we left it on full blast for 6 hours. The only way to tell it was even on beside the rumbling of the motor was to lay your face on the vent to feel the semi cool air. After complaining to the hotel staff we were brushed off and never was able to get a hold of them again. I would HIGHLY not recommend this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy. As the room may bake you alive with the heat and the staff just do not care.
ID-1122	I stayed at the Red Lion in Anehiem, CA. It was within walking distance of Disneyland, which was great. The interior of the hotel was beautiful. The marble floors in the lobby were goreous. The room was tastefully decorated, with a beautiful bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was clean. The housekeeping was great. I also loved the great HD TV available in the room. I would stay again!
ID-1254	My wife and I spent our honeymoon at Sandals Grande St. Lucian and absolutely fell in love the place. Our room was very spacious and had a nice flat screen TV. There was also three different pools to choose from. The main pool even had a swim up bar. Even better yet, the beach was amazing. This was true a true paradise.
ID-1196	When my family and I were on college visiting trips, this is one of the hotels we unfortunately stayed in. First off, the hotel was no where near the University campus, even though it was construed on the website that they were within walking distance. Note: I contacted their corporate offices and they have since taken this fact out of the hotels description.  The room was not no terribly spacious and the decor / ambiance of the room was very dated; think old floral paintings and an outdated lead-screen TV.  And it smelled! Oh dear god did it smell bad in that room. At one point, our family actually had to switch rooms entirely just to avoid the odor emanating from the bowels of Hell itself.  Would I ever go back to this hotel? Absolutely not.
ID-0795	This hotel was mediocre. It did not live up to the hilton hype. It was not priced correctly for the service I got. It was nothing in particular that caught my eye. The lobby looked like a HG t.v. magazine threw up in it. The indoor pool might as well had been outside due to the fact it was a random pigeon flying about freely. The food was not as well prepared as I had expected. The menu was drab and had a small selection. I really thought I was ordering from a kids menu. The room I was in had such a filthy carpet. It was like the people before me threw a party then checked out when I checked in. The bed was ok, but for 123 dollars a nite it should have been stellar. The bathroom was also a little let down. The tub could barely fit my husband. I would not ask anyone to pay for a stay here. I paid the hilton price for a motel six stay.
ID-0899	I didn't enjoy my experience in this hotel because their were insects in my hotel room and it seemed very dirty.
ID-0969	Me and my family stayed here during the 4th of July weekend as a family get-together and birthday party. The resort has it's own water park, which is nice, but that's about as far as nice got. Upon arriving, the rooms were not what had been described to the person who purchased all of the rooms, and they had to purchase an additional room to make up for the misunderstanding. Later, one of the rooms was charged to another family member who checked in early. Another family member was charged with room service fees for meals they never ordered or received (watch your credit cards closely!). The rooms were dated and the carpeting was gross. The location of the rooms are literally a drive from the front desk, so if you need anything, it's going to take a while. And the maid service? Non-existent until the morning we were all due to leave. For the price, this place was atrocious, and I would never recommend staying here, even with the water park (the added resort fee pays for that). Save your money.
ID-1118	I live in Houston and I usually stay at the Galvez Hotel on Galveston Island at least one or two times a year, as I live in Houston, which is about an hour away in good traffic. I like to go down there as a quick weekend getaway, to relax and unwind. They have a bed and breakfast deal that suits my needs perfectly. I’ve always liked their historical ambience, and they’ve updated the décor in recent times which makes it an even more attractive place. The staff is always pleasant and the rooms are always clean, peaceful and quiet, which are all major attractions for me. The hotel is supposed to be haunted, and I would love to see a ghost, but to date, I have never had so much as one paranormal experience. Despite my lack of ghostly encounters, I still love staying at the hotel because of its historic ambience, tranquility and beachfront location. One of my more pleasant memories of the Galvez is standing on the beach there at dawn, with coffee in hand and watching the sun come up over the ocean. The hotel is close to several of Galveston’s attractions that I like to visit. I come down to eat at nearby Pier 21 and have one of their shrimp poor boys, go shopping on the Strand and visit Moody gardens, which has a great saltwater aquarium and a wonderful rainforest pyramid, loaded with tropical birds and butterflies. If you want a loud, crazy place, then fly to Las Vegas, but if you need to relax and unwind, stay at the Hotel Galvez on Galveston Island.
ID-1152	The W Hotel in San Francisco, is conveniently located close to the Mascone Convention center and a couple blocks from San Francisco's shopping district - Union Square. The very chic and trendy hotel is well furnished, full of amenities like a gym and indoor pool, and the service is top notch. The rooms are very modern and there are several bars located within the building. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and will help guide if the most knowledgeable guest. I had the privilege to spend a weekend here and I won't hesitate to do it again next time I'm in the area. The hotel is also a stone's throw away from the SFMOMA - San Francisco museum of modern art for the art lovers out there.
ID-1242	I loved the time I spent at the Luxor. It combined an elegant design with an amazing staff. We stayed near the very top of the pyramid, and the view of the city was simply breathtaking. Even something as simple as using the elevator was a fun experience. Instead of simply going up and down, it's structured to take the unique slant of the hotel into consideration.
ID-1110	I loved the experience I had at this hotel/resort. The hotel was clean and organized. The heated pool was very nice when it was late and a little windy. The restaurant food was very delicious and fresh. The variety of food in the restaurant amazing. They had many typical Mexican dishes that were amazing. The beach was crystal clear and the sand was clean. I did not have to fear of getting cut or hurting my feet.
ID-1056	This is easily Seattle's most elegant hotel. The Fireside Room, a stunning, wood-paneled lounge on the first floor of the building, is in itself worth a visit. With frequent live jazz performances and cocktails, it transports you to a bygone era. The rooms themselves, though on the small side, are dripping with atmosphere. The furnishings are elegant, the walls accented with wonderful period details, and the bookcase (filled with real books) is a wonderful touch. Everything, from the bathrooms to the linens, has a wonderful, lived-in feel. And best of all, the hotel is only a few blocks from downtown! The location is especially ideal for those doing business at the conference center, which is only a short walk away. If you want a homey, refined atmosphere, The Sorrento can't be beat.
ID-0849	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is not even a hotel that I would send my worst enemy. Not only is the place in the middle of the armpit of America (Reno), but the hotel is just a mess. Everything, and I mean, everything smells like smoke. The smoking is supposed to be in the casino area only, but that is hardly the case. There are multiple restaurants, but they are usually closed and the food is horrible anyway. It is terribly old and it definitely shows in the rooms and in the casino. It is in serious need of a renovation asap.
ID-1130	On my last vacation, I decided I wanted to go to a place that was quaint and quiet, but still had a suitable level of culture to partake in. This place turned out to be Charleston, SC. After doing research on hotels in the area, I decided on the Planters Inn on Market Street, a quite luxurious hotel for the area featuring a 4-star dining experience. Upon reaching the hotel the staff was friendly and greeted me warmly. Check-in was a breeze and soon I was off to my king room accommodations. Outside the room was a little round, iron-wrought table set for two overlooking the courtyard. The tall white columns were freshly washed and looked new and fresh plants were out. (The weather was a bit dreary the entire time, so I didn't get to enjoy that feature of the hotel very much.) Once inside with my luggage, the first thing I noticed was a card with my name on it and a teddy bear in the middle of my ginormous bed. The card welcomed me and the bear ultimately became a keepsake for my nephew. The bedroom was beautiful, and the bathroom was just as nice. The first thing I did was take a nice long, hot bath in the jacuzzi. It was the perfect way to unwind after my drive from Atlanta where I'd just barely fled some unseasonable snow. After the bath, I ordered the duck from the 4-star Peninsula Grill and a glass of champagne. It was my first vacation in almost a decade and I planned to live it up! My stay lasted a week, and all in all, each day was the a slightly different rendition of the first. Between sightseeing, visiting shops for gifts and keepsakes, and hitting up a few bead shops for my jewelry line on Etsy, I got to relax in some of the most luxurious accommodations I have ever had the pleasure of partaking in. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, were all friendly and quick to answer any request. (Once I saw a bellman delivering chocolate covered strawberries that were not on the menu, he made sure I got some too!) It was a fabulous hotel and a place I plan to visit again in the future. Thanks Planters Inn!
ID-1100	I had one of my best hotel experiences in this establishment. This hotel is located right on the beach, had plenty of amenities and the people (both guests and employees) were full of energy and really made me feel both welcome and happy.
ID-0967	We didn't feel at home at the Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport from the moment we got there. The room was not clean, we had to scrub the bathtub before we even thought about using it. Airplanes continually roared above our room, which must have been right under a major landing path for the nearby airport. We expected a higher level of service and room amenities than we received. The outdoor pool was not heated, and it was frigid for late-August. The pool area was also not clean. We were glad for the morning to come so that we could leave and be on our way.
ID-1190	America's Best Value Inn - Golden Gate is just that, a great value near Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel was located near several different bus stop lines, which made travel around the city very simple. The Golden Gate Bridge was about a ten minute ride away. As for the hotel itself, the staff was very friendly, they held our bags for us when we got there earlier then expected and also let us check in about two hours early after that. The room we booked was a King Suite and the size was great for only $50something per night. We joined their free discount club before we went, so the room was a great deal. The shower had plenty of hot water and the bathroom was clean. We had never been to San Francisco before and so we didn't spend too much time in the hotel but it was clean, the bed was large and comfortable and the staff was great. We plan on staying with them next time we travel to SF.
ID-1192	The Pearl River Hilton offers an incredibly upscale experience. The hotel boasts 17 acres of extraordinary landscape, a full pool, and a gourmet restaurant on premise. The staff is extremely friendly, and the rooms are very comfortable - all with a great view! Additionally, there are many conference and event rooms in a separate wing available for your next special event.
ID-0981	I am a business traveler that often had to stay at this hotel because the other options in the area were often sold out or more expensive (would get rejected by my corporate policy). Repeatedly, I was disappointed with this hotel. This hotel is stuck in a time warp for renovations and basic amenities. Even with recent updates in the lobby, the actual rooms lack the much needed updates. On one occassion, my room did not have towels or a shower curtain! Yes, the hotel can fix this but it shows the lack of effort and attention to each room. For a frequent traveler, I found the beds uncomfortable and lumpy. The blow dryer was old and while it seems like a small piece, it's an important luxury. The toiletries were as basic as they come and this is a Courtyard, I expect body lotion or conditioner! I have voiced my concerns to management and been contacted before but never heard back about changes being made. In 2011, I had to spend 78 nights here. I could change my travel schedule to avoid overnights so I would not have to stay here.
ID-0799	I recently stayed at the Astor Crown Plaza in New Orleans for a work seminar. My seminar was being held in another hotel in the French Quarter, so I felt that it would be best for me to stay in the French Quarter as well. I got a somewhat reasonable price for the Astor and thought that it was in a good location when looking at a map of the area. I arrived with a coworker very late at night due to plane layovers and was extremely uncomfortable when getting out of my taxi. There were probably 7-10 random people standing outside the doors cursing and yelling. I had to walk through these people to get to the door and there was no doorman to make me feel more at ease with the random cursing people.  I went to check in and it went quick enough, however the woman helping me spoke only when spoken to and seemed very annoyed that we were checking in - like we had interrupted something. Just handed us our room keys and looked back at her computer.   The room was fine - no complaints about the cleanliness. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep! With all of the commotion on Bourbon street below, you must bring ear plugs if you even want to think about sleeping!   I was in need of some water and went down the hall to the vending area and tried to but a bottle and was unable to because it was sold out. I went back to my room assuming that it would be refilled at some point that night or the next morning. The next night, I tried again - no water. I then went to several other vending areas on other floors and no water there either. I went back to my room and called room service and did receive two bottles of water. I drank half of one and went to bed. The next day, I left the room for my work function and came back to see that housekeeping had taken my water!   All in all, the location of this hotel is fine, but customer service, and water, seem to be lacking quite a bit! I will be returning to the French Quarter but not to this hotel.
ID-0957	I booked this hotel last week while visiting Philly. I am generally a fan of Hilton properties so when I called Hilton they offered this hotel which they stated was 15 minutes from downtown Philly. Boy where they wrong. this hotel was actually a 40 minute drive from the downtown area. When my girlfriend and I checked in, we did not realize that they were renovating the lobby and certain rooms, I with the telephone representative would have stated this!! Also, they gave us a corner room on the 2nd floor all the way at the rear of the building. The door to our room was ajar when we entered so I thought something was suspicious. there was a 30 minute delay in order to switch us to a different room. not a good experience. will not stay until the renovations are all done.
ID-0809	We arrived at the hotel about 5 pm. First of all google maps gave us the wrong address. Sent us 10 miles up the road. (not blaming the hotel). Then we went up to our room and the A/C was not working properly. The ac knob was broken and we could not turn it on or off. It took them about 2 hours to get someone up to fix it. Besides that the stay was blah. Nothing major or nothing to get excited about. I requested a partial refund and finally got one only because I am a priority member.
ID-1256	Indian Hills Inn Taos Plaza is a great place to stay, especially for the price. We were in the middle of everything -- the shops, the restaurants -- and could pretty much walk everywhere. The parking was great, even though our stay was during Spring Break. The room was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We'll book again the next time we're in Taos.
ID-1007	I recently stayed at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a regular guest at Red Rock Station Casino, their sister property. I was enticed to stay at Aliante because of a deep discount they were offering. However, our experience was so bad that the hotel should have paid US! The directions on the hotel's website were outdated. The route took at least half an hour longer than if they had taken another freeway. We finally arrived and got up to our room. Despite opening less than a year ago, our room had many things broken or missing. Lights were burnt out, the television remote did not work unless we sat one inch in front of the television, our bathroom toiler paper holder was ripped from the wall and the sink water pressure was horrendous. They also forgot to stock our minibar, despite checking in much later than the usual arrival time. We tried to ignore the poorly-maintained room by dining and gambling downstairs. We first tried their cafe. The service was horribly slow and the food was tasteless. We next tried their Pancake House. The food was covered in vinegar and was disgusting. After those two meals, we drove to the nearest grocery store and prepared the remainder of our meals in the room or ate at restaurants off of the property. I shared my complaints with the reservation agent upon checking out and he did not seem to care. I will never stay at this location again!
ID-0903	Did not like the service that i was provided, when i entered the hotel. I also did not like the area, in which the hotel was located. Too much noise and events going on for me to feel relax and away from the city life.
ID-0935	I stayed at the Ramada Hotel in Cordele, GA for three nights while I was visiting relatives. We tried two rooms before we found one that had working air conditioning and didn't smell of mold. The third night we were there, the air went out in the third room. We complained and received a full refund and will never return to this hotel ever again. The girl at the front desk didn't seem to care if we weren't happy at all.
ID-1144	I like the motel 6, it was very affordable for what it was. Didn't have a bad odor like most motels. Pretty clean rooms.They are pet friendly so I didn't have to pay extra for my dog. Which is a money saver. I like the pool in the middle of the property where you can see rooms from pool.
ID-1076	Recently, I stayed in Las Vegas at the Motel 6 Tropicana. I loved this Motel 6. It was newly remodeled, and they allow pets. I travel with my dogs, so being able to bring them in is a plus. The newly remodeled room was very pleasant. I stayed in a non smoking room. It was very clean. The bathroom was spacious! The room was decorated in bright colored paint, and had a flat panel TV. The Motel 6 Tropicana, is located two blocks from the Strip. It made walking to the Strip a breeze. The staff was very helpful in finding a room on the first floor of the two story hotel. I also travel with small children, and needed to be able to access the room without the hassel of stairs. I'm planning another trip to Las Vegas in the very near future. I've already booked a room at the Motel 6 Tropicana.
ID-1031	I chose this place because I was on a budget and was only staying in town one night. Upon getting there I realized that you need to pay extra for internet access, which was still slow. The room was smelly, and the bathroom was gross. Luckily I brought my own blankets and pillow, because the bed and its linens were dirty smelling. The only thing that would redeem this hotel is the fact that it is located around lots of shopping and restaurants.
ID-0937	We stayed here on our way from Miami to Key West. We only had to spend a night, so we found first hotel that was available. The hotel is on the highway 1 so was the first (and only) one we tried. We paid about $60 for a room, which I thought was a bit too expensive for the hotel and neighborhood, but I was too tired to hunt for bargain.  The hotel was rated as 2 stars. I have stayed at other two star hotels, and the rooms looked comparable at first sight. However, the first room that was given to us had a terrible smell of bleach. We couldn't stand there for a minute and went back to reception and got another room. No smell in other room. Once we settled and unpacked, I started noticing small problems. The refridgerator was too loud and at night I woke up and unplugged it. The bed was so fragile that everytime I turned in sleep, it squeeked & my wife woke up. The flush in bathroom was leaking. It flushed regularly every 5 minutes and made noice. The hair dryer was not working. The hot & cold indicators in the bathroom was interchanged. Above all, when I complained to the receptionist while checking out, she looked at me as if I was being too fuzzy. No wonder none of the problems were fixed yet. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel.
ID-0845	The Sheraton Garden Grove Anaheim South Hotel is a newer built hotel on the Anaheim strip, but because it is newer, the location is very far away from Disneyland. Unlike the pictures, the hotel itself is rather small, with an tiny outdoor pool that is surrounded by the parking lot. The staff is present at best, and any questions or concerns are quickly passed on and not adequately resolved. I was under the impression that this Sheraton was the other hotel that was indeed closer to Disneyland, only to my dismay that this hotel is actually closer to an old liquor store and food stall. The rooms were really cramped and were not the cleanest for being such a newly built hotel.
ID-1070	Beautiful, amazing, spectacular setting. I loved the workers, the food, and the quietness i was being provided. It seem like I was really on vacation rather than on a business trip. One of the best hotels in the city I been to thus far. Five out of five for me.
ID-0925	Recently my fiancé and I stayed at the Oceana in Santa Barbara. The hotel room was small, over priced and offered precious few amenities. Most troubling, however was the decor and furnishing which were old and dated. My fiancé complained that the furniture was so old tha she was convinced it was dirty. She believes wicker furniture belongs outdoors and acts as a strong dust magnet. We will not return to this hotel.
ID-1236	I stayed at the San Bernardino Hilton located on 1755 S Waterman Ave, San Bernardino, California and received the best service out of all the hotels I've been to. I had a single room that was equipped with 1 king size bed that included 250 thread count linens non allergenic feather pillows a 32 inch LCD flat screen panel TV with all of the good movie channels. i slept like a baby in the huge king bed until 12pm and had the up most comfort with the light and sound blocking curtains. room service was great and courteous very well-mannered professional people even during a dispute with another customer, they still maintained their level and handled difficult situations with ease. their 24 hour Pavillion Market was awesome and convienant, I was able to purchase items I forgot to pack along with a few grocery items when I didn't feel like having room service, which was not often since the food was so delicious, especially breakfast.
ID-0865	This was by far one of the most overpriced Day's Inn hotels I've ever stayed in. The rooms are dark and dingy, and it has a very old smell to the whole place. The pool was tiny, so don't come here if you really look forward to a good swim! We stayed here for a few days during a move, and were very happy to leave when it was time.
ID-1090	The Holiday Inn Express in Pueblo, CO was a great experience. The staff was friendly and accomadating. They served breakfast longer then usually due to the large amount of people at the hotel that weekend. The breakfast was free, delicious, and hot. The staff never allowed the food to run out. Also, it has a 24 hour gym, warm indoor pool, and a hot tub. The beds were like heaven. The pillows were amazing. I have never had that good of a nights rest in a hotel before. You will never be able to find a better staff thean the staff at the Holiday Inn Express.
ID-1260	I recently spent 2 nights at Club Quarters in Philadelphia. Not only is it conveniently located to the historic sights, shopping and great options for meals, the staff were super friendly and the room was very comfortable. I was not sure how to use the computer to check-in, but someone came and guided me through. She even offered me a cup of coffee and some fresh warm cookies. One thing I really liked was the refillable and reusable water bottles that can be filled with filtered water. What a perfect thing to have for sight-seeing. After check out I had several hours before my bus was to depart, and they were very accommodating and stored my luggage for me. I will definitely return to Club Quarters.
ID-0891	NOT RECOMMENDED. The elevators are slow, the rooms are small and the staff is very rude. My wife called the front desk and asked for fresh towels to be brought up to our room. The clerk told her that he was busy but she could go downstairs and get them herself. She asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't one. Terrible customer service!
ID-1250	The hotel was amazing! The rooms were so big and comfy. We brought our dog with us and the welcomed her that was a huge plus for us. We also forgot a playpen for our son so we called the front desk and they brought one right up! Everything was perfect.
ID-1240	We stayed two nights here just recently & found the place itself a great location. Yes, the room is small but it did not bother us as we were hardly in the room. We had a King Suite. It was called that because it had a mini sauna in the room. The room was clean & had a simple decor.   Do ask for a room at the back of the motel. It will be quieter than the front as you can hear the traffic from Lombard.   Wifi was a strong signal & had no problems connecting right up.  Parking is first come, first serve & there is not much for the size of the place. We came in late on Friday & found the last spot available & just decided to ride Muni for our entire visit. It was very convenient to catch, as there was the buses that ran on Lombard, Chestnut & Union Street.  When we checked in Friday, the clerk was nice. Checking out, another guy was very rude when we asked to leave our car a few ours, which we would have had it moved before others would be checking in & the parking lot was empty. Aside from that, we did not have any interaction with the front desk staff.   I would definitely stay here again as I found the rooms clean & loved the proximity to everything plus it was a reasonable price compared to other places in the area.
ID-1040	The Grand Hyatt New York is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. This is an ideal for the business traveler, as they provide Wi-Fi, a 24-hour business center, and a spacious work area in the hotel rooms themselves. They also have ample meeting space and offer catering for meetings. Ample modern audio visual equipment is supplied so there is no need to bring any along. For those who have traveled to midtown for work, it is a very short jaunt to just about any midtown office building. Cabs are readily available in inclement weather or if you have a heavy load to carry. The hotel concierge can arrange car service as well. The hotel is very gracious about honoring special requests, such as early check-in, late check-out and high floors/quiet rooms and rooms away from the elevators. I have stayed in many business hotels in New York and the Grand Hyatt New York exceeds them all.
ID-0995	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Vintage Plaza for the first night of our honeymoon, before we traveled the next day. While the hotel itself was beautiful, most of the staff friendly, and the amenities pretty spectacular, one event marred our stay and has left us completely unwilling to ever stay in this facility again. The day we checked out, we realized that we had forgotten one of the cards we received from family on the desk. We called the front desk just before we left town, and they said they'd have housekeeping check for the card and bring it to the front desk.   A week later, when we returned, we called the hotel, and they advised us they had found the card. We stopped in on the way home, and I went to the front desk. They handed me the card, and I was shocked to find that the envelope had been opened! I immediately asked to speak to the manager on duty, and when I pointed out to him that someone on his staff had opened our envelope, we were rebuffed stating that, no one on his staff would ever do that. I knew I wouldn't get any further with him, so I left. I did write a letter to the general manager, which also was rebuffed with the statement that, no one on their staff would have opened the envelope, you must have done it.   Needless to say, we will never return to this hotel, and will never recommend it to any of our friends.
ID-1214	This hotel is very clean. Rooms were very nice in size. Cookies at the front desk just waiting for your enjoyment and pleasure. The hotel provides elevator service with luggage carts for your convience. They have a wonderful hot tub and pool to cool off after a hot day here. This hotel has a laundry facility as well. It is no wonder why people return here year after year. The service here is very warm and down to home. Comfort awaites you here in the country.
ID-1038	The Aquarius hotel and resort in Laughlin Nevada is like being in Las Vegas. It is easily the best hotel on the strip. The ammenities alone make the Aquarius my preferred hotel. They offer an Adult tower, which we always request. The beds are unbeleivably comfortable, which is exactly what we need after spending 4 nights camping on the river. The showers offer the perfect water pressure and lots of hot, hot water. The rooms are large, the views great. Besides the ammentities, the buffet is also the best on the strip, with the best salad bar, and the choicest selections, not to mention free drinks. Definately not the hospital-type food other Laughlin hotel buffets offer. And, the casino itself is the best - funnest slots, good payouts, roomy with good ventilation and lighting. But my favorite part of the Aquarius is their club card. Every month I get two free nights (weekends included) plus free tickets to concerts or other Laughlin events! it's almost like a free mini-vacation every month! Love you Aquarius!!
ID-1068	The La Quinta Inn in Brownsville, Texas was conveniently located right off highway 77. It was a fifteen minute drive to South Padre Island from the hotel which was a great trade off considering hotels on the island are at least three times as much a night. We had a large room with a king sized bed that included a microwave and a small fridge. The bathroom was large and bright with an extended curtain rod for the bathtub, which felt like a luxury. The maid came in everyday to fix the room and always left us new towels and soap. The desk clerk was informative and helpful.
ID-0863	I really didn't like spending the night at this hotel. The area it was located in was sketchy and I didn't feel safe at all. The inside was relatively clean and the staff were nice enough. The continental breakfast was really gross though.
ID-0815	I have stayed at the Luxor before but it was many years ago when it first opened. I liked it much better then because now when I stayed there it seems like everything has gone downhill. The upkeep seems poor and it felt like their rooms have been downgraded rather than upgraded. I now understand why the room was so cheap. The worst part of my whole stay was the bed in our room. It was like sleeping on wooden boards. The bedding material was slim. There was only one sheet between us and the mattress and there wasn't even a box spring under the mattress. Then there was a sheet and our blanket. After a night of drinking I assumed going to bed and passing out would be the easiest thing to do. Not even close because it was the worst sleep I have ever experienced while staying in Vegas. Not only was the bed horrible but the entertainment and decor on the inside is dull. There doesn't seem to be much to do inside the Luxor. However, the location on the strip and easy access to adjoining hotels makes it easy to find entertainment elsewhere. I have no problem paying an extra $20 per night to stay at another place on the strip where I can get a good night's rest.
ID-1086	We decided to have late evening cocktails and dessert at The Living room in the Peninsula, after a nice evening out. Service as always was excellent as is the ambience.
ID-0943	I stayed at the Holiday Inn in Rosslyn, and it was gross. My room smelled bad and was very dark. The wallpaper is peeling, the bathroom was dirty, and I had trouble sleeping because my bed was so uncomfortable. Elevators take forever, the place needs to be modernized, and the hotel staff is not particularly friendly.
ID-1158	We recently stayed at the oceanfront hilton in virginia beach and enjoyed our stay very much. We were warmly greeted by the staff at the front desk and completed our checkin very promptly. We requested a standard room but ended up getting an oceanview room at no extra charge. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The decor of the room was new and pleasing. The view was outstanding from the 8th floor and the hotel was located in a great spot which was close to activities and restaurants. The staff was very polite and willing to help us with anything we needed. They had a restaurant on the first floor that served some amazing sea food dishes and had a large selection of beer and other drinks. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone. We were very surprised with the value of this hotel and will be staying here again on our next vacation.
ID-0797	My children and I stayed at this hotel in New Orleans in January, 2012. When we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait for over 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the front desk. Once we finally got the key and made it to our room, the room was dirty. There was even a dirty town in the floor from the previous guest. I called the front desk to complain, however, no one showed up to clean until the next day. There is supposed to be a perk at this hotel where they have free hot snacks in the evening. They were anything but hot. It was basically room temp chicken nuggets and hot dogs. Find another hotel if you expect to have an enjoyable stay. This one was total disappointment.
ID-0798	Its really nice place to stay especially for business and tourist purpose.
ID-0799	It seems that hotel does not check the basic amenities in the room, before handing over the room to the traveller.  The phone in my room was not working and it created a problem for me, as after a hectic day of travel you would like to relax and work at your own pace. So they sent the technician who kept on looking for the fix for about an hour and then i had to get my room changed.
ID-0800	Worst hotel I have ever encountered. I will never think to stay in thiis hotel in the future
ID-0801	Had a good time in this hotel and the staff Kumar,aishwarya, and the house keeping guy not sure what his name these people make my stay pleasant and happy for 5 days. For sure I will be back to this place to stay in chennai.Good job guys
ID-0802	good hotel and staff Veg food good non veg breakfast needs improvement
ID-0803	Great hotel. The staff if welcoming. Helpful. Always there for you.
ID-0804	"The hotel is mostly clean, but bathrooms need some care, our first bathroom had no hot water, the second one, took a very long time to drain off the tub. Plus painting and caulking were peeling off the wall.
On the plus point, great restaurants and excellent customer service."
ID-0805	Awesome hotel with all needed amenities and luxury, friendly staff, great food
ID-0806	"Very nice 
Comfortable"
ID-0807	The staff of the hotel were polite.  The brick oven chefs were extremely helpful and all the meals were very good.  The room was as advertised and clean.  My stay of 2 days was very comfortable and I would recommend this hotel  to others.
ID-0808	"Overall a pleasant stay.
Veg restaurant was the best experience @ decent price."
ID-0809	I was on my business trip & my stay was for two days, I found perfect hotel with excellent cleanliness and location is also perfect, nice. In all, it is value for money hotel. Suggest to offer at least breakfast included in that offer in case of single occupancy. For double occupancy it is a great deal.
ID-0810	Location : In T Nagar. Very close to the shopping hub and also a few cult South Indian restaurants like Saravana and Murugan. Room : Spacious, Well-lit and clean rooms. Staff : Courteous staff with a simple 2 mins check-in process.
ID-0811	Very good stay. Nice location. Suggest to offer breakfast included in that offer. Also check to offer for complimentary pick up and drop to airport. These things add value to offer and certainly increased business. All the best. Will certainly recommend to stay at this hotel.
ID-0812	Its value for money. Its a pleasant experience. They have to improve the reception. Otherwise nothing bad about the hotel. Breakfast is super and the staff are very courteous. I like to stay again. We enjoyed this pleasant stay.
ID-0813	Cannot think of any negative for this hotel. Right from check in to check out, it was all smooth and an experience to remember. One for one offer for residents at Zodiac made it better. Located in the heart of the shopping district and easily accessible by all modes. Some of the staff had difficulty understanding English, rest all was good.
ID-0814	Table and chair not clean. Not value for money. PC lan cable has so much dust but WiFi Internet speed is too good. Bar service is too bad only one waiter serving to all customer. Serving food like tandoori chicken is very salty.
ID-0815	Good experience and good hotel to stay. I recommend my friend to stay at accord. Location is good and the service was also good. I have rated 5 star for this hotel. Continue the same service you will be the topper.
ID-0816	The overall experience of the hotel was good. I had visited this hotel with my family. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout was on time in the hotel. The service was good in the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. All the amenities were provided in the room. The food was good in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel.
ID-0817	I am taking this hotel as 4 stars since the rooms are so small and we can't place our luggages in a suitable place. Japanese restaurant was not good. Food are so small quantity. Not worth the money.
ID-0818	Neat and clean good service very good location good service by house keeping etc
ID-0819	The Hotel is centrally located in T Nagar area and also it is a luxury hotel with good rooms and staff is very courteous too. The food at the restaurant is the best thing about this hotel as they have a lot of options to eat. The food taste and quality is very good.
ID-0820	You could stay there, it's a nice place. The hotel is good, the location is good, food is excellent. Well built and cleanliness level is above 100. Overall, it was a good experience, you'll find it worth the money spent. Thanks!
ID-0821	I had visited this hotel for official purpose. All facility was provided in the room. Everything was fine at the hotel.
ID-0822	Nice Hotel with good amenities. Nice Room with facilities, good Service and decent Breakfast spread, Value for Money! Situated at the prime place, easy connectivity and easy to locate. Good for families, groups and Business purpose. It was a comfortable stay!
ID-0823	This is a very good hotel in the heart of the city and offers good value for money. I book this most of the times when I travel to Chennai. The staff is very courteous and they do everything to make your stay awesome. The restaurant options are also many and you are spoilt for choice. There is also a lounge on the terrace which offers a great view of the city
ID-0824	We had a pleasant stay there. The staff were very friendly. Don't rent a cab from them as they charge lot more than other regular service providers.
ID-0825	The service is good ,the also provide free Wi-Fi internet connection ,the breakfast is ok but need to do some improvement .
ID-0826	Close to shopping, nice restaurants, good breakfast.
ID-0827	Excellent staff.very friendly&helpful.however timetaken to resond was poor.breakfast menu could be better.daily toiletry &towel replenishment insufficient.but overal stay was pleasant.
ID-0828	"Facilities: Nice ; Value: Fantastic; Service: Professional; Cleanliness: Pleasant; 
There's three restaurant inside this hotel so there is plenty of variety"
ID-0829	Perhaps they were making most of Chennai being almost Sold-out during my stay duration but asking for 5k without even basic facilities like complementary bottled water... Wow!!
ID-0830	stayed with my wife in January, 2016. Very happy experience.
ID-0831	Front Office staff welcoming and helpful at every turn. Overall a comfortable stay. Rooms are small, but more than adequate for a single person.
ID-0832	Nice and comfortable and ideal for my activities
ID-0833	The physical facilities are quite nice - large clean room, comfortable lobby - but little things detract. The safe malfunctioned the day before I left, the WiFi bandwidth was overly maxed out during evenings making email impossible, the fitness room was a joke.
ID-0834	The location was perfect.
ID-0835	Good
ID-0836	Check in took more then 45 mins, all the 4 pillows in the room where of different sizes, dirty and stained curtains, no phone next to bed and you have to walk to the study table, slow room service, poor understanding of how international bookings work, do not accept discover cards,
ID-0837	Room was very clean and well maintained.. breakfast was extraordinary..
ID-0838	My stay in The Park was a very pleasant one. The front desk staffs were very friendly,helpful and warm. They arranged even a cradle for my 2 month old baby. The room was well maintained and the complimentary breakfast had a wide spread. Overall the experience was a pleasant one.
ID-0839	This property is a bit old. Bath tub, toilets are old and had stains. White towels were provided, but even they had stains and dirty.
ID-0840	"The hotel rooms are quite old and are not maintained. The chair cushion was torn. Shower curtains, window curtains and even the phone had a musty smell. Wait at the reception was too long. 
Breakfast was decent. Location is very good for US visa applicants."
ID-0841	Wifi needs to improve
ID-0842	This place is probably better for business travelers but its definitely cramped for families. The bathrooms were very small and i felt I like was in a plane toilet. The location is outstanding though and accessible to almost everything in mainland chennai.
ID-0843	They have a good lobby and good place to eat. Everything else comes no way near the 5 star hotel that they claim to be. Rooms are just about 3 star hotel level. Was just disappointed. thankfully had booked here only for a day.
ID-0844	"Need to improve cleanness

Need to improve customer careness

Employee at resturent are should care enough all the customers"
ID-0845	Need maintaince there was smell in the room. Breakfast was good.
ID-0846	As soon as we entered the room our first thought was not to touch anything as it was very dirty. room was worse then a cheap motel room and you wouldn't want to get close to the bed. This is definitely not a 5* hotel as mentioned on Expedia. Its close to US consulate but with rooms so bad I would rather travel a few minutes then stay here.
ID-0847	The hotel is well located in central chennai. Its easy to find places to go out in the evneing after work, or for shopping at the two big malls nearby. They have a nice pool on the 8th floor and several bars in the hotel.
ID-0848	Nobody attends phone. Rooms are very old & small. Very small outdated tv
ID-0849	While the location, room, facilities are good. There is lot to be improved on service levels especially at the time of check-in and checkout. The staff at the reception counter possibly are not trained well or there is too much of attrition of trained staff. Wait for checkin/checkout is too long and not acceptable from a star category hotel.
ID-0850	Great location. But this hotel is not worth the price they charge. Terrible room layouts. Staff is slow and not trained properly. Guest services will not pick up phone. Had to call 4-5 times before they pick up. Spent lot of time to handle requests put on reservation at time of booking.
ID-0851	The hotel night club DJ is good and good place for party goers yyy66
ID-0852	Cleanliness at restroom and corridors and pathways could have been better. There is no hot water in the morning time before 8am. Hot water problem was there on both the days of stay. Couple of lights were not working.
ID-0853	Room was spacious. Maintenance is bad with cracked walls, water seepage. The hotel management needs to spruce it up. Not value for money. Location is great though. Very centrally located and in the heart of the city.
ID-0854	If they can accommodate the check-in with your arrival time it will be good. We had to wait for 3hours after reaching the hotel to get the room, though it was booked 1month in advance. Location is very good. Hotel staff are very helpful.
ID-0855	This hotel was at perfect location near US consulate. Hotel was very beautiful and well maintained. Was filled with mostly people who have came for visa interview. Staff also was very helpful and cooperative.
ID-0856	Pros: Centrally located - close to the us embassy, food at hotel 601 was good, friendly staff, decent gym and swimming pool. Cons: Poor rooms/worn out floors, over prized, long waits for checking out.
ID-0857	Enjoyed my stay. Very pleasant service. My stay included buffet breakfast which was excellent. The location is very close to the US consulate which is a big advantage. There are lots of eating options within a few miles radius. Will recommend luxury rooms.
ID-0858	Need inspiration? Check out other reviews for The Park Chennai written by travellers like you or read some tips on writing great reviews. Need inspiration?
ID-0859	I made a booking for my guests, my guests were not allowed to stay in spite of a booking and payment being made online, my guests were made to wait at the lobby nearly 5 hours. Finally, I gave my ID proofs to accommodate them and yet it was not accepted and had to find a alternate solution in other hotel. Not a customer friendly hotel.
ID-0860	It was very nice to stay in the park hotel with all the well equipped and its clean, I am happy to stay in future.. Its in right location for us to stay and hotel reception staff and service team are very polite and professional, I have not used much facilities which are available but next time I will try to use more.
ID-0861	The rooms renovated are also leaking, Water seepage is there in the walls. Very bad maintenance. This hotel is good for pubbing only. Mattress very soft and you get back pain. High time they replace the mattress.. Renovation is a must at this stage. Always hot water problem is there and taps are leaky. Health faucet must in the toilets.
ID-0862	Overall a good place to stay. Food was good. Rooms were clean and have enough space. Best place for visa interview as the place is right opposite and in case you forgot something for visa, you can get it quickly from room.
ID-0863	Except for being in the heart of city the hotel has nothing to boast of. Food tasted awful so much so, that we almost ate with pickle as a side dish. Breakfast room is poorly lit is enough to make your morning dull. Rooms unkempt and falling apart.
ID-0864	Hotel rooms are to be repaired in the bathrooms. As walls are to repainted. Outside windows are not clean, birds made dirty on that. But inside rooms are clean and well maintained AC Services are good.
ID-0865	Bathroom dirty , room dirty bedsheets not changed only positive thing is the buffet breakfast
ID-0866	Hotel staff are not co-ordinating well for the room service and Billing payment.
ID-0867	I am not sure why someone wants to spend that kind of money to be disappointed.
ID-0868	This is an ideal hotel to stay in - clean, friendly, good wholesome food and excellent value for money for a discerning customer. The staff are pleasant and helpful in all areas - reception, dining, housekeeping and concierge services. Try it and return again.
ID-0869	Good
ID-0870	Dinner buffet was not too pricey and food was amazing! The only downside during my stay was the discoloration of water in the bathroom sink.
ID-0871	Great service, clean room and nice ambiance. I stayed with my family and we had a good time. I would recommend not just for business stays but also for families.
ID-0872	Great staff, Good location, good food. Cleanliness need to get improved, every thing else is good
ID-0873	Excellent experience, clean room, friendly and courteous staff. Good restaurants in the hotel, nice food.
ID-0874	Very helpful staff and you are really taken care about things that you need.
ID-0875	"Room service poor. Service took time. Also the tray was not cleared.
Dissapointed with that.
Location of hotel is good.
Buffet dinner and breakfast was good.
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this. 
Nothing more to say other than this."
ID-0876	"It was great. Food is expensive, but good. Taxes are high. And the hotel car to the airport was $25.00 plus taxes; that was expensive; I could probably gotten my own taxis for $10.00-15.00. 
Great place and excellent service."
ID-0877	Excellent hotel with great staff. Would greatly recommend.
ID-0878	Hotel room is great, and the staff are very helpful. Located on Anna Salai, So forget taking a walk to get to nearby places. Add ons like lunch/dinner buffet costs too much- but this is expected. One thing I did not like is the presence of too many staffs and the  'vanakkam' they perform at the front door-I did not need that every time I come in- just a smile would have been enough. But the hotel as such no complaints.
ID-0879	This was my second visit. Enjoyed our stay very much. Will definitely stay at The Raintree when I am Chennai next.
ID-0880	The hotel location is good... but the beds are very bad and old. The shower room was not all clean.
ID-0881	Very good experience. All very attentive staff and very good location
ID-0882	"Facilities: Top of the line; Value: Fantastic; Service: Outstanding; Cleanliness: Immaculate; 
the perfect base for any visitor to Chennai - I'll be back"
ID-0883	The service could improve. A lot of time taken for room service.
ID-0884	While we appreciate the staff & service, the bathroom taps, dustbins, cleaning of WC, ventilation in the room (windows are permanently closed) need your attention.  Please check and make it right. We really had to adjust.
ID-0885	Good service and fairly comfortable stay
ID-0886	"Rooms need a make over.
kettle is old & not in good condition.
Not upto Lemon Tree standard"
ID-0887	Good hotel and room. Not too far from the airport - about 15 mins. Helpful staff, restaurant maybe overpriced but not bad. Bed was comfortable and clean. Free WiFi wasn't really good. Overall quite satisfied.
ID-0888	dated - router is outside in the front - rooms in the back has poor to no internet - food is sub standard - age and heavy usage is taking toll - needs major renovation to keep up with US chains.
ID-0889	We asked for a non smoking room but we did not get one and the AC was not working.. otherwise good location, clean beds and towels ...
ID-0890	Excellent in terms of hygienic and cleanliness. Enjoyed stay. However food prices are comparatively in higher side. Co-operative staff. Best in class. Would like to stay again. Thanks to Leman Tree staff.
ID-0891	Hotel is good. But food cost is too high
ID-0892	The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are well maintained and clean. The hotel is close by to the airport hence it is very easy accessible. Breakfast, lunch and dinner quality is just too good.
ID-0893	Good and enjoyed the stay. Good food. Neat and good room service. Location of the hotel also very good. Near airport and Railway station and IT companies. Sure I will again visit your hotel. Too good for family stay too.
ID-0894	Compared to other lemon tree stay, this was bit disappointing compared to the room comfortability.
ID-0895	Very very very very very poor Service. Very very very very very poor Air Conditioning. Very very very very very poor Service. Very very very very very poor Conditioning.
ID-0896	The size of the bed is so small that a single person is uncomfortable to sleep. They sell the same bed on double occupancy. Difficult to imagine how two persons can fit on the bed. Washrooms are so small. One can barely move around. Breakfast truly is free. Not complimentary. Food was absolutely not having any taste. Totally waste of money and uncomfortable night.
ID-0897	Room allotted is small. Single bed in the room. Buffet dinner spread not upto the mark. Quality of food not upto the mark. Breakfast quality need to improve more. Spread of fruits not liked. Need to improve. Moreover, cost of buffet dinner does not match with quality and spread.
ID-0898	The room size is small & not as big as you see in photos. The service was good overall. The quality of food at the Bar & restaurant was not that great & they could improve the quality of food & also even reduce the rates.
ID-0899	No doubt hotel is located in quiet prime location for business travellers but I don't think it is value for money given the room size. The staff is pleasant to deal with. Food variety is also average. They should have facilities like spa for business travellers also who wish to relax after a long day.
ID-0900	The overall experience was good in the hotel. The hotel was located near to the airport. The behaviour of the hotel staff was good in the hotel. The food and drinks were available in the hotel was very good. The activities were not available in the hotel. Wi-Fi service was available in the hotel.
ID-0901	Everything that you need was in place.. There was no need to call for any Services. Food quality is also equally good. The location is also convenient for air as well as rail. The reception staff is also very cooperative.
ID-0902	Very clean, value for money. Prompt service. Beautiful aroma. Only problem is view, which is comprise able. The buffet dinner was asko good. We were even provided with take away breakfast at 4:30 in the morning.
ID-0903	Cleanliness and hospitality was excellent. The complimentary breakfast was good. The only room facility which was not up to the mark was internet, too slow. I stayed as single but rooms would surely can accommodate a family. Worth for the money I paid so would surely recommend for a short stay.
ID-0904	The first thing is, it's too costly for a small room. I am not satisfied with your time schedule for. This type of feedback format is somewhat not good for us. And I'm sorry for late reply.
ID-0905	This is actually a 3 star hotel, and in India there are 7 stars, and so a four star rating in Expedia is very misleading. The hotel is not very clean, but for a 2-3 star hotel it is ok if that is what you are expecting, the prices were way too high for that level of quality. I moved to the Hilton, and was very satisfied.
ID-0906	Nice experience... Some people i think some workers were shouting outside my room door which was disturbing
ID-0907	All boxes ticked for a Business Traveller. Clean Room, Clean Toilets, Decent Break Fast Spread.
ID-0908	Nice stay..very good service...especially the person named mr. dinesh who is in reception assisted me a lot.such a good person in the hotel..he assisted me till the period of vacate..very good person..
ID-0909	We really enjoyed the pool and the food as well. Well cleaned. Definitely recommend to any one
ID-0910	Stay somewhere else, This hotel is right on the flight path to the airport, and is adjacent to the main road  where lorry drivers use the horn more than the brake
ID-0911	We stayed at the Park Hyatt  for a week primarily to attend a family wedding which was being held there. The hotel and the service were very first class but unfortunately the area where it is  located is not good. The rooftop pool is very pleasant. Food and drink in the hotel is very expensive and the bar area which is not open until 4pm is very noisy with disco type music on at full volume. Nowhere to sit and  have a quiet drink.
ID-0912	Staff have been very helpful to help me avoid Channai pitfalls and support me while lost in translation.
ID-0913	Moved to this hotel after a terrible night at another.  This hotel is amazing.  The service is top notch.  The decor, especially if you are in the garment industry is stunning. Food is great. Can't say enough good things.
ID-0914	Quick efficient friendly check in. Overall great hotel in Chennai. Will stay again.
ID-0915	Nothing to complain
ID-0916	was good . letting my guest with ease next time would be appreciated . was good . letting my guest with ease next time would be appreciated
ID-0917	"First time stay. Loved it. Everyone was super polite, helpful, nice.
One needs to check the final bill as there can be errors."
ID-0918	It was a pleasant stay, Excellent experience, great ambience, very courteous staff and the hotel caters customers needs round the clock. Rooms were too good, Will ensure to stay again in future and recommend to all my friends. Keep up the good work Thank you Hyatt certainly very good value for money. Kudos!
ID-0919	Overall ambience of the hotel is very good. In room facilities need to improve & there is a need for providing services as per customer booking. 3 people in same room has been provided with 2 persons facility whereas the charges remains for 3 people.
ID-0920	Park Hyatt really lived to the hype. The best part of this hotel is the bathroom and roof top swimming pool which gives you a great view of Chennai. Their flagship pub Flying Elephants is really happening on the weekends and as a staying guess you get a free entry to one of the most exciting pubs. The service and ambience of this hotel was top notch and unparalleled.
ID-0921	My experience of the hotel was very nice. The transportation facility was not provided by the hotel. The activities were available at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers.
ID-0922	Very good service, very clean, great food and nice gym. 15% less in price would help my pocket..
ID-0923	GOOD.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
ID-0924	This is a very good hotel with modern looks and excellent service. Staff is quite friendly and food is good. Staff feels happy assisting you for almost anything. Everybody treats guest like they are someone special. Rooms are quite spacious, clean and equipped with all amenities which are needed.
ID-0925	I had visited this hotel with my family. The food quality was good. The service at the hotel was nice. The check in and checkout was on time. The complimentary food was provided at the hotel. The restaurant was available at the hotel. The varieties of food were provided at the hotel. I donâ€™t have any suggestion for this hotel. I would recommend this hotel for other travellers.
ID-0926	nice place good staff i can feel the quality of money food is also good but little far from city i feel house keeping also good
ID-0927	As soon as I checked-in, I found pungent smell in the room. Even after informing customer service desk, it took them quite long time to allocate new room and that to after multiple follow ups. Moreover, the food served at room was not good. It looked that it was not prepared by chef.
ID-0928	Great ambience, good staff, wonderful food, big rooms. Accessibility to Airport, nice location and all at reasonable price. Mine was a short but comfortable stay. Overall, 5 star stay. Recommended for future stay in Chennai.
ID-0929	We stayed between Xmas and New Year 2015 for 3 nights in this wonderful hotel.The location is absolutely brilliant being only 300 yards from the town Square. We were lucky to get a 'free' room up grade to one of the superb loft conversion - two level room with the four poster beds -Nice ! . All the staff were very helpful. The breakfasts were good
ID-0930	It was a bright Sunday and myself with my family decided to check-in Park Hyatt in Guindy and as we expected it was the experience to cherish. It gave the absolute delight of being in the star hotel and the food quality was splendid. The service was also upto the mark of a five star hotel. Summing up all it made it crisp experience on Sunday morning.
ID-0931	There is no business centre. One doesn't expect a hotel of 4.5 star not to have a business centre.
ID-0932	Excellent value for quality and service. Can't go wrong. Breakfast is top notch with Indian and continental options. Decor is subdued but stylish. Good for business or pleasure. Gym has modern equipment with an infinity pool. No problem with free wifi. Better deal than Leela Palace. Family was very happy and thought the hotel was on target.
ID-0933	Excellent room and exercise facility. All around atmosphere was calm and comfortable. Main dining room offers both excellent food and service. Avoid Flying Elephant restaurant, stick to the main dining room.
ID-0934	comfortable. not needed.bkhkhjuoipoioioi hkhghkhkhkjh ghjggjhghggg
ID-0935	The outside look and feel very good. They have a reasonably good restaurant
ID-0936	"Very clean!
Great Service!"
ID-0937	Very nice hotel. Good location. However the sad part is that the 24 hours check in/ check out policy is not applicable for booking made on hotels.com . They said it is only valid when you book directly with the hotel.
ID-0938	The majority of staff at the reception and in the dinning hall were excellent and welcoming.
ID-0939	good
ID-0940	I saw a much better upkeep of the facility two years back
ID-0941	"There was no confirmation of my booking as per their record.
I had to wait for 30 minutes"
ID-0942	"The room is clean, international standards, option of turning on ceiling lights if you prefer brighter otherwise is warm and cosy.

Toilet small but funtional and water pressure good (16th floor room)."
ID-0943	We had great experience in staying here. Check in and check out process was smooth and easy. Decent food options were available at the hotel. Staff were responsive and quick for any requests. Roof top restaurant and view of the city is one not to be missed.
ID-0944	Reception on arrival and at the restaurant is Excellent. Check-in and Check-out formalities were handled efficiently. Room is big in size. Ambience is excellent. Food quality at restaurant is good. Service representatives in restaurant took care so nicely - my special appreciation to them. The location of the hotel and the surrounding ambience are pleasant.
ID-0945	Decent hotel but buffet was not up to expectation. You can have better lunch or breakfast for that money
ID-0946	Really enjoyed the buffet food with it's wide variety
ID-0947	EXCELLENT***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ID-0948	It was a good experience. We had a very wonderful time there. The service was excellent. They provide the best service. Thank you for such a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work and maintain the hotel as it is.
ID-0949	24 hrs check-in is the best part about this hotel. Service is great, Staff is helpful and friendly, food is good and excellent location. I always enjoy my stay here. However the Gym should be improved. More space is needed and equipment requires major upgrade.
ID-0950	Good hotel and nice location. Staff is very supportive and took great care. The pub is nice and ambience is awesome. I would strongly suggest this hotel for any business traveller. It is situated in the heart of city and in main market area.
ID-0951	Great location, very close to city center and markets. Staff is very helpful and service is great. We had some special requests and they helped us with all of them. Enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to others.
ID-0952	I will definitely stay this hotel on my next visit to Chennai. Very good ambience. Shopping centres nearby. Facilities are excellent Staff is also good and supportive
ID-0953	It has extremely great ambience and the rooms are good. Liked the experience. The buffet was costly however the food is good. The swimming pool was great and the gym facility was good. I enjoyed playing in the pool and the cleanliness of the pool was appreciable. Overall rating : 4. 5/5.
ID-0954	Nice hotel with very good ambience. Nice reception and overall design. All locations are designed to feel good and spacious. People are very soft and gentle and skilled to serve all kind of guest including foreigners.
ID-0955	The hotel reception staff are very bad. Even the other services in the hotel is same only. I ordered fish fry but got very bad smelling really totally damaged one. Breakfast is also not up to the mark.
ID-0956	Very homely and safe environment. Breakfast excellent. The check in and check out was very simple. We called and asked for a late check-in and check out which was honoured. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of the shopping centre. The hotel was very safe as we were traveling single.
ID-0957	Centrally located. Great food and rooms. Reasonably priced. Hotel has one of the very good pub, though the food quality was OK. Little disappointed with food at "Southern Aroma", my most favourite restaurant. Overall experience was great.
ID-0958	Complimentary breakfast was given by the hotel. The hotel was good. There was no delay in check in and checkout at the hotel. I was satisfied with this hotel stay. I didnâ€™t use activity in the hotel.
ID-0959	Friendly  and  helpful  staff. Nice food. Clean rooms. Really enjoyed our stay. We stayed  at  this hotel  3 times before.  We go again.
ID-0960	Excellent hotel. Great value for money. Great staff. I stayed for 2 nights, and hence was initially offered complimentary breakfast for  2 days only. I checked out the third day, after breakfast hours. Hence they were gracious enough to offer free breakfast for my family of 3 (which runs about US$ 25) for free.
ID-0961	Pictures are the service does not match ..
ID-0962	nice stay for my first night after arrival to India
ID-0963	The place is neat, rooms are adequate with all amenities, bedsheets are clean. Wifi connection is good. The place is walkable distance from T. Nagar which is a shopping area. Buffet breakfast at a restaurant downstairs is really good and serve wide variety. Staff is friendly and helpful, they assisted us whenever we needed. Overall happy with the stay!
ID-0964	A nice comfortable stay in heart of the city ,which also very affordable compared to others nearby
ID-0965	I was stayed for official purpose ..It was located in the main city and very easy to locate and room appearence needs to improve . The Room has more sapce and is good to be there. Cleanliness was maintained .. Overall experience in service needs to improve.....
ID-0966	I have stayed there on a business visit. The first thing is the location of the apartments. It is in the heart of the city. (T. Nagar). Very easy booking procedure. Only thing about the morning complimentary breakfast quality is not enough. They can improve it. Overall very nice to stay.
ID-0967	It was good staying there, the welcoming was good, maintenance was comfortable, breakfast can be added on with any hot drinks with it. People were good, cleanliness was maintained, service for any calls was good to fill up water bottles. Can have some more comfortable zones like games, added environment to like the place more. Just not to the see it as room alone, if it would be a more comfortable, the stay would be really memorable.
ID-0968	Good hotel, I visited for official purpose. Service is average and room size that I got is small and very congested, may be other rooms are big as I am not sure. But economically the hotel is good which you stay with your family with less average charges. Food is below average which you will get only complimentary breakfast which is too bad. Otherwise hotel is good.
ID-0969	I have stayed 2 days on 30th and 31st March 2014 for Nestle company meeting. Service was good and the 3 rooms attached with a big hall that was not seen in any hotel really different. If a family stay they will feel like home. Need to improve in food quality and quantity, overall experience was very good.
ID-0970	The hotel is located at a very strategic place from where all the things are very nearby and one would not face any challenge. Its not a very big hotel, however the staff is cooperative and we had to manage the food from outside mostly. Overall it was a very good location with average experience.
ID-0971	Business trip for two days, very nice hotel, location is good, close to us consulate, close to market place, Railway Station and Airport. Neat and clean, nice food, nice restaurant. Friendly staff with quality service. Enjoyed the stay.
ID-0972	Blossom serviced apartment are a fully furnished apartment in Chennai that serves with excellent amenities and great customer care. This serviced apartment are a boon and more economically viable alternative to a hotel rooms. it has more space , convenience factor and great privacy level especially for family members and children .
ID-0973	 average services
ID-0974	 no restaurant
ID-0975	Location is very good near T.Nagar, the best market area. We passed leisure time to stroll the market. Breakfast was free in the restaurant in the ground floor. The persons in the reception were well behaved and sober.
ID-0976	The hotel was the best I had stayed in in India so far but a few issues annoyed me. The control panel for certain items in the room as in the air conditioner and the hot water heater so I had a few cold showers and a hot night.
ID-0977	Feeling very good and nice place, if we travel next time we want to book same the hotel. Hotel staff is very nice, they are co operative

ID-0980	Good ambiance, clean rooms, staff is cooperative, except that the location is some 500 meters away from main road, superb service. Did not try the food as better options were available near by. Only problem is its location, otherwise value for money.
ID-0981	The hotel is decent and good enough for 1 or 2 nights with family or friends. > Overall Simply Good. The MD is good and the staff is also good. > Location is a bit crowd and narrow roads. Cannot park vehicle outside the gate entrance. Should park vehicle inside and there is parking place also. > Near to Malls and restaurants.
ID-0982	It was good enough and value to the money. Very near to Marina Beach. Services are good and food is okay.
ID-0983	Hotel Peace Park Inn very good hotel for stay with family. This location is not good but hotel rooms & services are very good. Hotel reception is very good. Food is average. I like this hotel.
ID-0984	Average. Hotel location not as per address given. Difficult to track hotel addres

ID-0986	I had been here for my brother admission. Hotel is very clean. Rooms are good bigger and AC works well. A great value for money. Food is awesome. Room service is also good. Check-in and checkout was done without any delay. Thanks to staff for so much of cooperation. Whatever pictures of hotel and rooms are there on their website, you will get the same thing in real.
ID-0987	I had visited here for an business tour. Had an nice experience. Room could have been bigger, anyway room was clean and neat. Location of Hotel is quite difficult to find. Food was also good. But Parking place is quite not safe. Budget friendly hotel. Hope I will visit again.
ID-0988	Spent two nights in this Hotel in September, 2014. The room was clean and tidy, clean bathroom and aircon worked. Staff at this hotel were very helpful and the driver they arranged for a day trip was excellent. A nice cool clean haven to come back to after tramping around the streets of Chennai.
ID-0989	 polite staff
ID-0990	I arrived late at night from Thailand looking forward to a drink at the bar only to be told that it is a Muslim hotel and alcohol is strictly forbidden. Other than that disappointment it was very clean good staff and good value. Probably a hotel that not too many westerners stay at, but good location.
ID-0991	Never came across any issues in this hotel. simply best...
ID-0992	We stayed there for 2 days and I have to say, I am impressed. The locality was not so good, but the rooms were pretty neat, I have to admit. The hotel provides Wi-Fi facility for its customers to be connected at all times. Their reception of customers was really great and they even gave us rebate of 700/- INR. It's pretty close to the airport, so itâ€™s a good choice for anyone.
ID-0993	Hotel is in the mid of city & located near by Marina beach but very conjuncted space in front of hotel. Food is not so good for North Indian people staff is good & room service is ok hotel is good for middle class people only no space for parking.
ID-0994	We stayed there for US Visa appointments and it was the best choice I think we made. Apart from the shabby ways, everything else was perfect. It is little inside, close to US consulate offices and marina beach. Hotel staffs were too good and helping. Overall, four out of five.
ID-0995	nice and clean, and though the neighbourhood seems somewhat dodgy, it's near to the beach and the main streets (with the awesome ananda bhawan restaurant just a few mins' walk away).
ID-0996	okay to stay for one day.Approach is not good but once you are in hotel it doesnt matter.
ID-0997	Ok, not bad.
ID-0998	I visited Chennai in the summer of 2014. This hotel is nice! It has high speed fans, A/C, & a useable bathroom.  My room was clean! Considering the price & location, this was a pleasant stay. The rooftop restaurant provides a kind service and tasty food! For mosquitoes, I suggest using repellant anywhere you go.
ID-0999	Breakfast spread was good. Staff very good,helpful. Over all a comfortable stay.
ID-1000	"The hotel is average. Good service but rooms looking a bit worn and old fashioned. Not many places to relax and coffee shop not comfortable.

ID-1001	"Excellent food at the Hotel, plus reasonably priced.
All staff were very friendly."
ID-1002	Excellent food especially breakfast buffet and supportive in arranging local transportation
ID-1003	I was traveling with my colleague from Italy, I found very average..the staff was good but I did not like the hotel it seems to be very old hotel had lots of mosquitos in the room. Very old furniture with old ihome system which is not compatible with the current iPhones and iPad. I expected more out of Radisson ..was not my best experience.
ID-1004	Main benefits of this hotel is proximity to the airport given the extremely heavy traffic in the mornings. Otherwise the hotel is not up to Radisson standards and the rooms are small and cluttered.
ID-1005	It felt like 4 â­ï¸ Shabby. Very convenient to the airport.
ID-1006	The hotel was kind enough to decorate the room for our night from wedding, the rooms looked great..
ID-1007	extremely good breakfast & lunch buffets with very helpful staff
ID-1008	Rooms were of a very high standard and although we arrived about 9.30 our room was ready for us. Staff were very helpful.

ID-1012	Great service and stay experience. Staff are always ready to provide service to fulfill the guest needs. Nice bar and buffet at the restaurant in the ground floor. Great hotel for business stay or for holiday. Easy to get around the hotel and also to get transport to get around the city.
ID-1013	Excellent experience starting from the pickup at Airport to drop at Airport. Pre allotted room with precomputed registration and handing over of keys and other information in the car itself giving excellent feel. Nice spread of menu for breakfast and dinner. Well made rooms and other services.
ID-1014	Superb hotel. Their hospitality was superb and all marks to them. The breakfast was superb. All was good. The airport pick and drop was excellent. Nothing wrong there. One touch service was excellent. The only weaker part was the room were old fashioned. They need to renovate it. Not really wrong with the room but the modern room this days are excellent. Worth the money.
ID-1015	Good neat hotel with friendly staff. Nearer to airport wit drop and pick up facility. Bit found food bit costlier. They do maintain a good quality. A perfect place to stay with family. Specially the club room with bathtub. Children shall enjoy the stay.

ID-1020	I had visited this hotel for official purpose. The appearance of the hotel was good. The hotel was located in the centre of the city. The check in and checkout was done on time. The room was not so neat and clean.
ID-1021	Good hotel to stAy in Chennai. Fflhlxoxoxitxtxttcolgtcoxgxtixkrxrxfllxdridxfizgxoxixxtoxothcgchochcypyfcycoycyycyycpufotdtodtodotxyycpycyxpgxgpxyoxtoxpyxttxylhxpxphxogxttxxoh gcocgxggcogctcoggxotxoyxyxyocicotxotxxotxpyxyoxyoxoyxttxtixttxxhxoyyxxdypxyocyycogcxoxoycyycoyh
ID-1022	Staff courtesy was excellent. My reservation issue was clarified immediately. I have 2 suggestions: 1. Need clothes hanging facility in the bathroom. 2. To have someone enumerate the facilities available for breakfast. It was confusing because many items were on offer, but had to be asked for.
ID-1023	"The staff were very helpfull and welcoming....

Airport pickup chauffeur service is great & Convenient!"
ID-1024	Hotel room were nice. Complimentary drink and foot massage. Staff was very good. I would recommend this hotel especially if you are taking flights. Close to airport, free transfers to airport.
ID-1025	This hotel had wonderful food, lounge, spa and rooms! We really appreciated this great choice of location to unwind after flying several hours from the US, and then flying out again the next day. The massage and spa staff were great, the breakfast was very enjoyable. We will definitely stay here again.
ID-1026	Stay at the hotel is good for the given price. However it was mentioned in the booking email breakfast is included for three days stay. But hotel receptionist say it was not included and ask me to check at HOTELS.COM. I did not get any reply from Hotels.Com until I vacate the room. So I paid for my breakfast at the hotel.
ID-1027	Nothing much to write about as it was just one night to stay. Terrible breakfast , unclean plates cups etc. the first room they gave was smelling of cigarettes smoke fortunately they changed the room. AC was just about ok. Small tacky room
ID-1028	Overall good , room are need& regular cleaning. Hotel Staff are very good
ID-1029	Good hotel location is good
ID-1030	I am giving the review as average just because I booked through MMT and got the deal at about 1150/- per day. If you are going for the hotel booking then they will charge about 2500/- etc. Which is absolutely not at all worth it. Rooms are OK if you get it at the range of 1000 to 1300.
ID-1031	Radisson Hotel Delhi
ID-1032	Pros Location-Value for business people they wnt stay at room fr long time Cons Very Old Building-Feels like the building will collapse at any time. Overall it is not well recommended but it's good for budget travellers
ID-1033	Rooms are not maintained. Old rooms. Bed and mattresses need to replace. To maintain subsequent visit of guest stayed once all above required. Space in the room is also less.
ID-1034	Nice Hotel as located in main biz Dist) which saves local conveyence with lively bar. Rooms are worth of money paid with complimentary breakfast ... Above all allows 24hr check in and out
ID-1035	Everything up to mark. I mean i had pleasant stay only thing upsets me is room service .. Very bad response .. Apart of that everything was good. Its at prime location
ID-1036	Rooms were small, can't accommodate the a third person. Service is bad, took 45 min to put a third bed, then 35 min to get a blanket. Breakfast is bad WiFi was disappointing Paid food is really good Rooms bathrooms are clean and well maintained.
ID-1037	Service was decent. Food quality is average. Location is excellent. Rooms are also average only. Cockroaches in the bathroom and room. Very close to Marina and Chepauk stadium and connectivity to Chennai Central and other areas is very good. Worth only if you have a good deal online.
ID-1038	Location and cleanliness is good, but as far as customer service is concerned, it is just average. Recommended for travelers to stay with reasonable rent. Since, the hotel is situated in Mount Road and it is accessible to all city areas. Food is just okay. Good for a quick stay.
ID-1039	Ideally located average hotel, cleanliness is average, small rooms, good breakfast and situated in Mount Road accessible to all city areas. Behaviour of front office staff is good and recommended for travellers to stay with reasonable rent.
ID-1040	Location and cleanliness is good. But as far as customer service is concerned, it is very worst. Even the manager doesn't respond well. Worst behaviour of staff. I didn't expect this kind of behaviour. It would be great if makemytrip does something about this.
ID-1041	It was nice stay for me in this hotel because the location of the hotel was near to the city only. And staffs was also do operative. But manager of this hotel was tottaly good because I did not face any problem in this hotel related to the service food or anything. For me it was value for money. And if I will come in this city so I will stay here only
ID-1042	Location wise hotel is perfect, but maintenance is pathetic. Rooms were ok but bathroom was not hygiene. Food is fine. Better option for amount I paid. Booked it through Makemytrip at lowest fare I believe. Thanks to Makemytrip,. Totally I prefer not to go again.
ID-1043	Was good.Hotel room was alright food too good service and nice locationNothing else .... .. ........................ . .............................................................................. .......................
ID-1044	I had visited this hotel alone for official trip. The hotel was very good. The location of the hotel was good. The hotel was nearby the railway station. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout was done on time at the hotel. The overall service of the hotel was good. The provided room was very dirty at the hotel. The activity was not arranged by the hotel. I donâ€™t have any suggestion for this hotel.
ID-1045	I think it was good, front desk team were very accommodating and courteous. Food was great and in room dining were very prompt. As a whole it's a good experience.
ID-1046	Great hospitality
ID-1047	i enjoyed lot .excellent hospitality
ID-1048	I didn't like it here. But if you're working in Mahindra World City you don't have any choice. A little competition could probably help things. Staff is nice. Hotel is blah.
ID-1049	great for people who come to visit Mahindra Tech City. Will save you from travelling back to the city in the evening.
ID-1050	I stayed there for one night, everything was great especially the helpful staff and breakfast, but there were visible stains noted on the bed sheet not sure if they changed the bed sheet or night.
ID-1051	Great location with airport transport. Breakfast was bountiful! Rooms were clean and spacious with Mini bar coffee maker and hair dryer. Roof top pool resteraunt and bar were amazing with a Daily Happy Hour! aC and Wifi!

ID-1053	Good Hotel with decent experience. Very courteous staff.
ID-1054	This was our first stay in india after we landed in chennai and started our 3 week trek across southern india. A splurge that we're glad we made. Helped us adjust our barrings. Its in a good neighborhood to walk around and explore. Staff was great. Highly recommend.
ID-1055	I stayed at Raintree with a few friends and while the facilities are great, the staff were rude and unaccommodating. I have two words to describe their attitude towards us - 'passive aggressive'. I was told this is a 5 star hotel. I can hardly believe that. Had a disappointing time because of the service. Facilities are great. Food is overpriced.
ID-1056	Great experience. Really good hotel with very professional and friendly staff. They are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay.
ID-1057	Be careful with the taxes on your food order, while the food prices was as expected, I ended up paying about 25 usd for a glass of wine, supposedly house wine, because of \"heavy local taxes\". I wish I had been informed before receiving the bill...
ID-1058	Overall very good, quick WiFi.
ID-1059	Great hotel and breakfast buffet. Outstanding staff. Stayed with my family but probably ideal for the business traveler.
ID-1060	Raintree is a good hotel located in heart of Chennai. Room was spacious and Nice. Breakfast was amazing with at-least 4 cuisines on the spread. A visist at night to the rooftop lounge is recommended for the views. But if you are  on Business, be careful as internet is unstable and spotty. Recommended if business is not on your mind
ID-1061	"We had a very good stay. All the staff were attentive and helpful particularly my special needs for a man of 84 years old.
However the room was not adequately furnishes. Needs at least 2 chairs for husband and wife to sit and  drink Tea."
ID-1062	i work all over the world and hotels are part of my life the Raintree St. Marys is absolutely wonderful the staff from top management to resteraunt staff and housekeeping are very friendly and accomadating they make you feel at home but with better service :) definitley recomend this place for business or vacation . the location is great and they have three resteraunts all with great food
ID-1063	Excellent Service, Very Clean and Good Rooms. Helpful staff.
ID-1064	"This is a lovely hotel and the staff are very attentive. 
There is no alcohol served at this hotel which did not bother me but was a surprise to my colleagues so if you like to have a glass of wine with dinner it's not possible. 
Good location however close to businesses."
ID-1065	Taj quality is unparalleled. Attention to details makes the difference.
ID-1066	This is a wonderful hotel - absolutely five-star service throughout the property! Everyone made me feel welcomed and valued. Plus, the breakfast is sumptuous, and the Indian restaurant is quite amazing!

ID-1068	"Extremely courteous staff
Very helpful and attentive will do all they can to make your stay enjoyable and pleasurable 
Can find no fault with my experience or stay 
Loved my stay!"
ID-1069	Service minded staff, who attended to the residentsâ€™ requirements in a professional and courteous manner. Buffet breakfast was excellent with a variety that suits both Westerners and Indians. We tried vegetarian curries and Nan breads in â€˜Beyond Indus restaurantâ€™ on a number of occasions and must admit that the quality and freshness was superb.
ID-1070	An oasis of comfort in a busy chaotic town. A very pleasant and restful,a place I looked forward to returning after each day's foray into the busy city.
ID-1071	Nice hotel at the heart of town.. close to everything
ID-1072	Room was OK but not a five star like experience as the rooms look old and bulb fixtures, bed frame looks old.
ID-1073	"Valet parking: the ac control switch near driver's seat was broken hence self parking & having the car keys with the guests is recommended
Vegan food: their is no specific menu for vegan, in vegetarian 1 or 2 items are only vegan. Hence would not recommend breakfast here for vegans"
ID-1074	Excellent food, great club, friendly staff, room shows wear and tear, but very clean.

ID-1078	"Nothing to good to say about this residency hotel, chennai. A few notable negatives are the following:

1. NO Wifi
2. TV stop working every 10 minutes; the remote is so old that the numbers on it have gone away!!!!!
3. hotel staff is just miscerable; they dont know what a customer service is. Very indifferent and cold.

Very bad experience.  will NOT recommend to anyone."
ID-1079	"STAFF IS   NOT GOOD , KEY NOT FIT 2 TIMES AT NIGHT ,

ROOM 702 KEY IS GIVEN 2 TIMES I AM GET DOWN AT RECEPTION AT 1.45 AM .
THEN GIVEN ROOM NO 701"
ID-1080	Ac is not good..bed is not that much good.. it's not worth paying. .
ID-1081	Awesome stay the food was slightly expensive but other than that I dont think this deserves 3.9. The only thing is the room size is small compared to other luxury hotels
ID-1082	Stay was comfortable and service is good & satisfactory
ID-1083	The overall experience was good. However the wi-fi was getting disconnected often. We found the food very expensive.
ID-1084	Overall stay was good. However, the Wi-Fi was not working. We had to call them multiple times to fix it. It gets fixed for some time and then again they would stop working. This was the only thing that we didn't like about this hotel.
ID-1085	Great breakfast and good room service!
ID-1086	"all in all good..location is excellent close to everything

ID-1090	I stayed at this hotel with my friends for 2 days. Overall experience was very good regarding the service of the hotel. The staff were well trained and behaved friendly. The building of the hotel was well decorated. The rooms were big in size and were well maintained and provided with all the modern facilities. The room service was always on time. Food was also very much hygenic and tasty. Would like to visit again.
ID-1091	This is a very clean hotel I have stayed in this hotel before (7 years ago) they still maintain the same very good standard
ID-1092	This Hotel is Centrally Located in heart of Chennai. Easily accessible from Most of the places in Chennai. Walking distance to some of the best places in and around T Nagar.

ID-1100	Great Business hotel, but not really a place to take the family... The ban on selling alcohol may have an impact.  If you want a beer or a G&T at the end of a long day then you'll need to plan ahead.
ID-1101	Great hotel but sometime felt  too big

ID-1109	"I arrived in Chennai at 0430 on a Monday morning. The hotel had a car and driver waiting for me.  I was in my room before 0500 and enjoyed a short nap before my week started. Through out my stay, the team at Grand Chola was friendly, helpful, and very kind.  There are some wonderful restaurants, great pools, and good exercise facilities on site.
You will not regret staying at this wonderful hotel!"
ID-1110	Royal stay experience. It is slightly overpriced but you certainly get what you pay. Reception staff is very nice. Big lobby. Variety of restaurant like madras cafe, Peshawar & Italan foods. High security. Rooms are marvellous. Controlled by ipad, you can change channel, lights, a/c, door management, door camera, order food through ipad in your room which is very good. Food is excellent. Nice variety of spirits. Amazing experience.

ID-1116	It's a very pleasant and calm place with a combination of luxury
ID-1117	I've booked a room in ITC Grand Chola, Chennai, for my reception. After getting the room card the butler services start. They are with us like a personal assistant in every manner, every second. Totally a privatised hotel for couples. Such a lovely stay at a seven star property. Love you all staff.
ID-1118	I heard a lot about chola, but I found not to my expectation. Highly priced rooms, over priced food, and full of false pride staff. I think, I don't need two hundred words to describe Chola. Whatever I have written should be enough to understand hotel management.
ID-1119	Everything was nice and nothing to complain about. Breakfast was good with spread out choices line other itc properties. In room dining doesn't have many choices that's the only negative I would say about.
ID-1120	ITC Grand Chola - A Luxury Collection Hotel. Wonderful stay in great Chennai. Excellent location and facilities. Great hospitality and ambiance. Good place to stay. Beautiful rooms with free wifi. Excellent breakfast and last but not the least, a very good swimming pool.

ID-1125	"This is an excellent hotel if you are planning to be close to airport and conduct business.

It is massive and has two sections, and defo will come back to it if I am going back to india."
ID-1126	am enjoyed
ID-1127	In and out quickly and efficiently. Brief overnight stay before heading to airport which is a 15 minute ride away. Only hotel driver to airport was poor. Too fast poor lane discipline and too close to vehicles in front
ID-1128	Great hotel with excellent attentive staff. Very clean and quiet
ID-1129	Short stay arrived at 4.30 am from airport, departed at Noon. Check in swift which you want in middle of night. I had lost my HH card, they managed to sign me up again overnight
ID-1130	"Very comfortable and felt safe. 
Staff were very helpful and respectful. Breakfast offered a wide choice which cartered for every palate, started early and finished late."
ID-1131	The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. The rooms and washrooms are neat and clean. Rooms are well-equipped. Restaurants are nice, food is good. Staff is warm and pleasant. Overall, a nice stay. However, there is not much of a view from the hotel also is more suitable for business and family stay, not suitable for leisure holidays.
ID-1132	Conveniently located, staff really concerned on your comfort they ensure you get our issue resolved. I had a problem noise from ballroom was too much and my room was noisy. I requested the front desk they quietly accepted the issue arranged an alternative. Icing was they asked me to relax in the new room first and relocate the next day.

ID-1134	I had a great stay at this facility. I am a Diamond member who has stayed in many of your properties but I was especially impressed with this one.
ID-1135	Lovely hotel which is handy for the airport. Not the best location but once inside your away from the hustle and bustle outside. A short taxi ride into town or to the beach. Service and food were wexcellent.
ID-1136	My stay was good. The addition of the O2 spa was terrific...thank you
ID-1137	Amazing time at Hilton resort is very good and food served is amazing. Swimming pool at resort room was awesome. I can't tell you more about this amazing resort and I request you to conduct cultural programs. I had eaten chicken tandoori and the experience of the spicy food in one word is amazing.
ID-1138	Very good and supportive staff, clean and spacious rooms, neat and classy bathrooms, good food and ambience. Q bar menu and drinks quality and cost value can be improved. Rest of the entire stay was really good. One can actually plan to check in here again!
ID-1139	Stayed there for less than 10 hours before taking a long flight to Hong Kong. Staff are extremely professional. One of the the valet staff was super helpful. We wanted to go to a nearby mall and checked with hotel for transportation. Cab company contracted by the hotel quoted us Rs1200 while this valet was able to hire us a Ola cab for Rs 400.
ID-1140	Great Service, very much appreciate the reception staff went that extra effort to organise staff at the Chennai Domestic airport to assist with my extra baggage. Thanks you and Keep up the fantastic work guys.
ID-1141	Good central for business trips. A little on the higher side for the location. Rooms are tidy and new. Noise level is low, staff is friendly, Gym trainer is extra friendly. The new metro station has ruined the look from the front, but has aided connectivity.
ID-1142	The location is awesome, front office staff is very friendly, sweet and soft spoken. I like the stay, but room was very compact and beautiful, linen is very neat and clean, including towel, etc. The food was awesome, awesome service, woh, varieties and value for money.
ID-1143	The Hilton Chennai, is a lovely hotel with very kind staff and extremely clean and relaxing rooms. Q-bar on the roof is always hopping on Friday and Saturday nights and the food at the restaurant or room service will help any western travelers belly from getting delhi belly. Just wear your bug spray in the lobby from the mosquitos they are many.
ID-1144	The location of hotel is inside a colony and difficult to access without a vehicle. The breakfast provided by them is also disappointing.
ID-1145	Hotel is very good. Area is little inside from main road but easily get through there via google map... Maintenance is very good rooms are so nicely furnished. WiFi is there tv and most prob rooms are fully air conditioned. Overall good.
ID-1146	Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!Good Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!
ID-1147	Isolated place, very difficult to find the exact place, had to wait for long for food, cab taxi availability was a problem.
ID-1148	I had stayed in this hotel for a day and I had a good warm welcome in front office. Room was very clean with wooden flooring. Centralised AC, quick response with staff food was fantastic. North Indian especially, morning breakfast was good too, I would come back.
ID-1149	Though a business trip, it was good stay but I do hope it improves in due course of time. Since being single I might not have enjoyed the amenities but I do hope to visit next time with a friend or my family. I thank them for providing room service and good housekeeping services.
ID-1150	I had great stay in this hotel, this is the first place I felt people are keen and happy to serve you, with smile on their face was so genuine. They have created a good impression about the hotel the moment I landed in Chennai, and they lived up to it throughout my stay.
ID-1151	Average, since the destination is a business oriented one, hence has not much to offer for other target groups.
ID-1152	It was my lifes best place which i have ever visited
ID-1153	I like food, pool, staff, gym and location and a big reason for me to choose savera. Only I they could improve their internet, they would get 5 stars.
ID-1154	Not very pleasing. Hotel reception staff attitude needs improvment
ID-1155	This place is infested with roaches. The towels provided very old though clean. The place charges more due to its proximity with US consulate. Food is expensive. This is an average hotel but expensive for the rates
ID-1156	I had a pleasant stay with my family at this hotel, the lobby, the reception, and the swimming pool is very beautiful.
ID-1157	Not very good hotel ple do not take this hotel
ID-1158	We had a very nice stay at Savera
ID-1159	Not worth it for the money we paid..!
ID-1160	The Savera Hotel is an oldie but a goody. They have been in the luxury hotel business for 50+ years and are very good at what they do. The hotel is furnished really well, the breakfast buffet is scrumptious, the location is good (central but fairly quiet). The staff are really courteous and friendly and everything worked just fine.
ID-1161	"Bathroom door was terrible. No hand towel and water bottle provided. Bathroom towel was dirty and has to be changed. Room look looked old and worn out. Out side view is a concrete jungle and very badly maintained and dirty terrace
Breakfast was very good. Staff were polite and courteous"
ID-1162	"Great staff, Desk Rep Sibasan ( small build guy who take care on desk wearing glasses and dark skin guy)
very Delete repeated word helpful, great food with great environment. I am sure next time I will stay at hotel Savera."
ID-1163	ours was a short stay. rooms were well maintained and serviced. we needed a late checkout which was smoothly executed.
ID-1164	"Repeated follow ups for hot water and internet didn't fix the problem. The staff was prompt but in a 4 star hotel hot water and internet should not be an issue. 
Room service food was pretty bad and always cold."
ID-1165	good experience with hotel. Had good facilities. Near to US Consulate and Beach
ID-1166	Slow check-in, waited 30 mins for check-in. Room and bathroom was not clean. Waited another 20 mins for checkout.
ID-1167	It's really hard to believe that now with 3-4k in hand ... You can easily get a room in a 4 star hotel that too with complimentary breakfast. All thanks to MakeMyTrip and yeah the stay was really worth every penny spent. Cheers.
ID-1168	The premises is too good. However there is a problem with cleanliness in swimming pool water, otherwise overall experience is good. The hotel must look at its food menu rates. Better if you booked with Makemytrip app so that you can get best prices than any other travel app.
ID-1169	Great stay at Savera Hotel during my official trip to Chennai. Located in the heart of the city. 5 Star hospitality that you could expect from a porter too. Nice rooms and delicious food. Commendable room service. A lot of options in breakfast. Will surely recommend to my dear ones.
ID-1170	Good, please don't disturb by keep asking for review and sending many emails, I don't want any updates and don't force us to write 200 words, I am quite serious about this please don't force me to stop using MMT app.
ID-1171	Rooms are well-maintained but corridors are maintained poorly. Stayed only for one night but heard from my colleagues that it is one of best hotel with more than 80 years history. Can try to stay here with family and friend and also convenient for business meetings.
ID-1172	Nice and looks good. Better please provide some facilities like Mobile charger and all. Bed is OK but not cleaned well. Rest room is good. Rest of all hotels to compare nice and find. Buffet tiffen is very nice and food is also good.
ID-1173	We were in Chennai for admission of my Son at SRM University. The Hotel was little bit costly. But, stay was very comfortable. Food with different type of variety was mouth watering and tasty. Service was fantastic. Cleanliness and modern facilities are really appreciable.
ID-1174	Hotel location is good. It's near to German consulate and shopping malls. Breakfast was superb with many options. Room was comfortable. They have pool and its always occupied. And food quality is good. We had a great stay.
ID-1175	The hotel looked pretty decent from outside. However, the hallway was smelly and dirty. Room was smelling and very stuff. Bathroom was not clean and felt very suffocating. It's not value for money. Service was good and the people were nice. I strongly feel they could have maintained much better.
ID-1176	I liked the hotel, people are very nice, good service. But the room in which I was staying 411 would have smoking smell though it was a non smoking room. Ambience was pleasant, it had pool side hotel too, Swimming pool was also accessible for the guest, we enjoyed that too.
ID-1177	Room was very neat and clean. Business Standard room was quiet spacious. Very good buffet breakfast. There was a gap between floor and main door due to which, you can hear outside corridor noise and vice versa. This may be due to old construction of hotel. Its Gym and Pub - both were really good. It was near to Embassy so easy to move around. Service was good. I would suggest this hotel to others. It was value for money.
ID-1178	Hotel rooms were very poor with broken floor boards. Receptionist was not ready to take any feedback and no proper response for questions. I wouldn't recommend Savera to anyone. I was charged thrice the amount mentioned on the snack pack.
ID-1179	The hotel is clean and comfortable with a wide choice of food in its three restaurants. Staff are courteous and friendly. There is a very efficient travel desk. My request for late checkout was accommodated readily but the amount charged for a 4 hour over stay beyond their usual allowance of 2 hours was a little pinching when compared to the rate I paid for my 2 nights stay through Make My Trip.
ID-1180	Service is good. Just a bit pricey. For the same price a better quality hotel is still possible
ID-1181	The room was good but the health faucet in the toilet was on the wrong side, breakfast was excellent and the overall impression was good. The location of the hotel is central, very close two popular malls.
ID-1182	Room was VG.  Bit of difficilty figuring out lighting and electricity on/off functions and hair dryer was not working.  Over all a good value at paid price.  Front desk personnel were PERFECT.
ID-1183	It was very nice. I enjoyed my stay there at Raj Park. Amazing.
ID-1184	It USB one of the worst experience I had with Raj park
ID-1185	"Booked a Deluxe Room with an occupancy for 2 people. The room that we got had below amenities:

1) No Ventilation.
2) The room was stinky(The room was smelling like it was in close proximity with drainage) 
3) Congested (The room was very small)
4) The window opened(open the curtain) into a huge wall which was 2 feet away. Which means forget the natural light you cant even see the sky from the room with an opened window."
ID-1186	Very good hotel
ID-1187	Overall stay was good .
ID-1188	Breakfast was very excellent,as well room services also good
ID-1189	The hotel is excellent and value for money, thus was my almost 5th or 6th stay at this hotel, I prefer this due to location and near to airport, the hotel staff is courteous and helpful, they have good gym facility also which is handy white travelling to make up your routine workouts
ID-1190	Clean room. Polite front desk. Seemed overworked as a single person had to handle many clients. Breakfast had a good spread. Service at the restaurant was good. Good location in Chennai with easy access to all areas.
ID-1191	I stayed in the hotel for couple of days. The rooms were excellent and the room service was very good and the support staff were very supportive and helped me out to my request. I would rate the hotel best in it's class.
ID-1192	Please improve the room service. Rooms are not cleaned on a daily basis. Waiters should promptly come to the room when called upon. Besides a very good restaurant. Good food, good location, value for money.
ID-1193	The location and the ambience of the hotel is good! But the room was not clean at all. Asked for a room change which was not done. They need to clean the room before allocating. If this is taken care then this is an excellent hotel to stay in the centre of the city.
ID-1194	The best part was location. Other things were average. The service in restaurant was not good. Bar was good. Laundry service was good and in time. Quality of food was good. Staff was not smart. Their understanding of language was poor. Hotel was good.
ID-1195	0
ID-1196	Everything was awesome. They provide mini bar too. There is too much space for luggage and AC is too powerful. Feels like home when we are in this hotel. Food stuff is amazing. Buffet is amazing with lots of dishes snacks and that too free for breakfast and just around Rs 800 for Lunch and Dinner. Just love this Hotel.
ID-1197	This hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to good restaurants and shopping. However, Service is very poor. Staff seems very poorly trained and paid, and that is exactly the service quality they offer, breakfast not up to the mark, checkout will take a long time so be prepared to add 15-20 minutes if you have a flight to catch, coffee/tea maker in room dirty and not per a 4 star property.
ID-1198	Pros: Very good location, excellent cleanliness, friendly staff, nice breakfast buffet. Cons: Wi-Fi connection unstable and speed poor, food is very costly. I faced some problem with the locker and room access card, but they were promptly replaced. Except for the two cons mentioned above, very nice experience.
ID-1199	Nice stay .... staff interaction and their service is good... satisfied for the paid.....................................................................................................................
ID-1200	Very good room and nice facilities, breakfast was very good feel like homely food. But the negative one is the net access, that the WiFi connection was not working there properly. Otherwise very good room and facilities.
ID-1201	It was good. Worth the amount you pay. Location is good. Lot of things available nearby. Will book this hotel again in case I wish to travel to that side of the country. Overall a good and happy experience.
ID-1202	Hotel Raj Park is a very good one located in main location of city. The room ambience is very good. Food served is very tasty. The stay is really worth able for the amount we spend. Finally service given is nice. We can reach the hotel very easily from any corner of the city.
ID-1203	1. Very close to consulate and convenient for visa interview and finger printing. 2. Very good breakfast - variety and service. 3. Room was clean and worth it. Overall, top hotel especially for people coming for US visa.
ID-1204	Very unhappy despite paying more, waste of money
ID-1205	Got for a day and night. Nice staff. Upgraded our stay from Deluxe Double to Superior Deluxe upon our arrival. Very convenient for US Visa application center visits, hardly 2.7 Kms from Main center and 1.6 approx from the OFC. Good restaurants near by.
ID-1206	Convenient location. Good breakfast.24 hour checkout is very convenient when you have a late night flight.
ID-1207	The stay at this hotel was pleasant. The room was very comfortable. The staff was very friendly.
ID-1208	Very pleasant stay. It gave great joy to my family, especially daughters who were out for the first time. Adjoining with EA shopping mall is an ASSET!
ID-1209	Excellent stay. The staff was very courteous. Food was very good. Very convenient as it is attached to the mall. Room was clean.
ID-1210	Great hotel. Rooms were clean and large.  Hotel is attached to the Express Mall, which is convient.  Good service and breakfast.
ID-1211	It was a pleasant stay, for the time we spent in the room. Definitely worth  staying in, if one has  to spend a night at a hotel in Chennai. Reception was kind enough to check us in a couple of hrs prior to the standard check in time, something I was not aware of prior landing at the hotel.
ID-1212	Hotel need good Maintanance and breakfast was poor
ID-1213	Amazing
ID-1214	it 's got a veg breakfast
ID-1215	Arrogant Starff, the way they treated was horrible, i was terrible disappointed. worst Staff i have ever seen in hotels, and they are really crazy.
ID-1216	Hotel room was spacious and very large. The services offered by the hotel personnel are cordial and appreciable. Only discomfort was that the hotel was providing only vegetarian food items. However the adjoining food court in the EA mall was providing all types of food. Overall hotel stay was enjoyable
ID-1217	A++ friendly staff, direct access to the avenues mall, food quality great. Can improve by providing atleast 2 towels for a twin room. Stayed with my family for few days. Enjoyed the stay in e hotel. Will visit again.
ID-1218	Hotel E in Chennai is located next to the shopping mall - express avenue. My stay there was great and memorable experience. The room was very clean, neat and good. Bathroom is spacious and great. More choices of breakfast dishes need to be improved. It is recommended.
ID-1219	Food options are less ... Rest is up to the standards. Biggest advantage is it is near to the mall .. You can spend your free time in the mall. Both reside in the same compound.
ID-1220	Hotel is good one which is built inside express avenue mall with wonderful modern look. Food quality was OK ... Type, beautiful lobby area. Location is also good.
ID-1221	Had a pleasant stay. Staff and service is very good. Since the hotel is located in the city, it is very easy to go anywhere and in the free time we can roam in the express avenue mall which is located in the same premises. Would love to stay again.
ID-1222	I have a nice stay here. Everything was fine for me. The hotel have an entrance to the shopping mall from the lobby itself. That seems good. The staff of the hotels are very friendly and good behaviour.
ID-1223	Good hoe
ID-1224	Hotel is very good and rooms are very clean. The location is very good and it is placed in heart of the city. We can easily access to the shopping mall and it has a good ambience. The staff are good with good hospitality and breakfast is very good.
ID-1225	The best value for money and the beast in luxury. Great interiors, classy rooms. Very good access to mall and transport services. In the heart of the lies this beauty. Food not so great. Great over all.
ID-1226	Quiet hotel in the middle of town. Very convenient. Neat and tidy. Laid back. Service takes slightly longer than one expects. Not too much choice on the variety of food. Overall a pleasant and happy experience.
ID-1227	The location was good but the there was no service, you don't get the feeling that you are in a hotel. The room size is good, I found cockroach in my room and I found the hotel to bit expensive for the services.
ID-1228	It was my third visit to this property, excellent location, great people and it was my birthday and they made it memorable by celebrating with me. Awesome food, well maintained spacious rooms and value for money.
ID-1229	I keep coming here, it's a great place to stay at Chennai, but I always find if their customer care are more focussed they can get more out of a regular visitor. I tried connecting with them many time, but they don't offer comprehensive package to suit individual request. Any way, it's like choose your own, and I would be doing so till the time I don't look out of options around.
ID-1230	Overall, good experience. +ves: * Located inside a mall. Convenient location. * Big rooms. * Helpful friendly staff, though the guy at reception was cold but I would not let that cloud my overall good experience with the hotel staff. -ves: * Weird policy of limiting internet to only two devices per room. * No baby chair in restaurant.
ID-1231	Amazing friendly service, convenient location. Would recommend highly.
ID-1232	The hotel interior is really modern and spacious. Its strategic location added value for the money. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. In fact they even help us to get movie ticket as we are rushing with our busy schedule. The best of the hotel is its attached to a new shopping mall where you can get A-Z and you don't need to spend money on transport or worried to shop till late night. Definitely will visit this hotel again.
ID-1233	Perfect travellers hotel. Great services and wonderful food. The rooms are neat and clean and well kept. The newly furnished rooms are even classy. For regular visitors and tourists absolute value for money. No need of wasting money in needlessly fancy hotels.
ID-1234	The overall experience was very nice at the hotel. The activities were not available in the hotel. I had visited this hotel alone for official tour. All amenities like TV, AC and geyser were available in the room.
ID-1235	This hotel is very near to many shopping places and very convenient to restaurants and easy connectivity to almost all requirements and also very affordable to common man. Also good friendly atmosphere you can see many local sight seeing places near by this hotel
ID-1236	 excellent services
ID-1237	The food was provided with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. All amenities were in working condition in the room. The room was neat and clean. The check in and checkout was good. The receptionist was good and co-operative. The transport facility was not provided in the hotel.
ID-1238	Everything was good at the hotel. I had booked room in advance. In the hotel activity was conducted. I had visited this hotel alone for official work. I don't have any suggestion for this hotel. The internet connection was provided in the room.
ID-1239	I had been to Chennai in the month of November. Traveling towards the Chennai I stayed in Woodlands Hotel for one night & one day because of due to heavy rain very good accommodation to stay, far from city. Good food but room rent is expensive. But all so OK.
ID-1240	I was going to Chennai at last month for some work & visiting Chennai. Me & my sir stayed at hotel New Woodland. It is a big hotel. They have good swimming pool. We stayed here four days. I was enjoyed at Chennai. Like Gandhi sea beach, Merina sea beach, Golden sea beach & Chennai city centre.
ID-1241	The hotel which I like very much in Chennai. But swimming pool is chargeable. I suggest this hotel especially for family people. The hotel have much space for parking. Morning breakfast is very nice & enjoyable.
ID-1242	New woodlands chennai which gave me a homely experience with a luxurious touch for one whole night along with my family. The management totally makes the whole customer with 100% satisfaction.Coming across the food,they are pretty good in providing most Delicious and tasty food as our need.Totally staying here will surely gives you a lively home touch experience. Thank you......
ID-1243	Had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. Right from the pick-up to the smooth hassle free check-out. The food was tasty and we had a lot of varieties to taste. The best hotel in Chennai and the staff were very helpful prompt and cooperative. The service was excellent and will certainly recommend.
ID-1244	Great reception, nicely connected to various important places, nice walking area, swimming pool, two restaurants, good South Indian delicious food, security, you can visit with family. Most economical, I stayed in this place for a single night and was quite satisfied.
ID-1245	Extremely helpful staff, clean and comfortable room, splendid breakfast buffet.
ID-1246	"The additional bed provided was a disgrace
Did not provide the required sheets or additional towels paid for"
ID-1247	We would stay here again. Clean, comfortable, amazing food! Occasionally there were mosquitos in the room.
ID-1248	Best hotel with excellent staff specially John with great service at the restaurant. Great staff with great location in the heart of the city what else can you ask for and great value for your money
ID-1249	Its a great place to stay. Staff is prompt and perfect place for business commuters. Food is lovely. Location is perfect. I have been staying at this place on regular basis and highly recommend to all as its value for money property. Should have full size or bigger swimming pool.
ID-1250	In just few word, its worth money, absolutely amazing stay, staff will make all possibility to make your stay memorable. I had amazing stay.. It in my favourite list, & I make sure to repeat stay again soon.
ID-1251	The hotel have good facilities. Its hospitality and services are very good. Every waiters are very much polite. In its restaurants, we have many options, too. Just the swimming poor is a little small. TV channel have no HD Channels.
ID-1252	It was very high quality stay. The reservation team were able to handle my special request. Room as very good, with high quality firings. Only sad was part of fluctuating WiFi.
ID-1253	Guess! What greets you when you reach this hotel and just come out of your taxi. No, no garlands or a welcome drink but a bad smell of the drainage, I believe this is just opposite to this property. But other than that hotel is fine and stay was good. Though little dull than compared to other Radisson branded properties.
ID-1254	Overall the hotel is a cosy place to stay. But they don't have any added facility for enjoyment. It is located in the hub of the city Nungambakkam.

ID-1261	A Nice place to live at, a Little expensive though, but luxury comes at cost. All the basics amenities were provided. The hotel has a Nice bar and good three restaurant, the food was good but the in room dining menu was limited. Over all a good place with trained and cordial staff
ID-1262	The best place to stay when in Chennai .. A perfect combo of right location, perfect cleaned hygienic rooms, tasty food, excellent service .. Do visit the place when in Chennai .. Rate it the best place.
ID-1263	Stayed for one night at the hotel. It is centrally located very near Anna Salai road. The rooms are good with all modern amentities, buffet spread is very good, the staff is helpful and ever smiling. Swimming pool is too small. Lobby needs to be made more comfortable with having good seating area
ID-1264	The hotel was in great condition, the service at the hotel lounge was average. The breakfast buffet was excellent, they had the best spread and good food.
ID-1265	Fabulous and helpful staff. Great brand new hotel.
ID-1266	VERY DECENT DECOR AND COMFORTABLE STAY. GOOD FOOD, LAVISH BUFFET. VALUE FOR MONEY.
ID-1267	Fantastic service by staff at every touch point. They were very friendly and helpful, and especially so when we were stuck in Chennai due to the floods notwithstanding the hotel running at full occupancy. Cannot imagine staying at another hotel in such times - they have really taken good care of us!
ID-1268	"Very nice multi cultural buffet breakfast 
Wonderful on site restaurants"
ID-1269	It was a wonderful experience .. The hotel is neat and the staffs are friendly too .. Overall recommended for short stays ..
ID-1270	The hotel was very clean. Â The hospitality was excellent. Friendly atmosphere. Â You just feel at home. Â Great hotel.
ID-1271	Nice good hospitality front desk should be more agile and bell desk should get the luggages as early as possible.That is the only area they have to improve
ID-1272	"amenity, breakfast, facility is good compare to it's cost. people are relatively friendly while I am checking out I was requesting a bottle of water which is complimentary in room but they was charging it. 
breakfast is good in terms of variety of fruits and miso soup is available!"
ID-1273	The club room was comfortable & in pristine condition.Complimentary breakfast with multiple food choices.Overall it was a good relaxing stay.
ID-1274	This hotel is one of the best around in the area for both cost and location depending on target venues. For certain businesses in the area (which is a growing hub) it is very convenient.
ID-1275	We stayed there for a night. Myself & my friend. We felt that the hotel is value for money. Staff are courteous. Ambience is pretty good. Rooms are well maintainer with good decor and ample facilities. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Thanks MMT for recommending a good hotel
ID-1276	I visit this hotel every month as part of business trips and it is extremely good. Close to Mahindra world city, the hotel has all facilities and service, room quality, cleanliness and hygiene are very good. This is a fairly new property as well. This is must stay and only good hotel if you are planning to visit Mahindra World City area.
ID-1277	The hotel is closer to SRM university main campus. I had some work there and this was the best option nearby. The room, food and service was excellent. The property is only 18 months old and still looks very new. The breakfast spread was of international standard. Overall a pleasant stay.
ID-1278	We are happy with our stay and would like to stay again. Hotel Room is very Clean and service is OK.. We can understand the delay in service as that particular day it was crowded. But still there is room to improve in service.
ID-1279	I stayed there on business trip. Nicely managed. Got good rates on MMT. Hotel should start good price on meal too for business travellers. Overall recommend to stay if you need to be on that area. It is away from main city.
ID-1280	Good Hotel by all means very convenient and cooperative staff. Food is also pretty good it's very close to reputed institutions also automotive hubs. I recommended its the best hotel for stay who have the work those places. This trip was my second visit next time also it's my favourite.
ID-1281	Clean and tidy hotel. Staff are very professional. Only disadvantage. Little away from city without any continence stores in the vicinity. Wi-Fi is only limited to 2 users per room. Hotel should consider free shuttle to SRM university. Thus would considerably increase the occupancy.
ID-1282	After about an hour's drive from the airport once you reach the hotel, the first view of this ITC group hotel was quite pleasing. The inside of the hotel and the rooms were pleasant. Staff was gentle and helpful and the food was of good. It certainly was value for money.
ID-1283	It was fantastic and value for money. I enjoyed a lot with my dad and brother. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Room service was perfect.
ID-1284	Compared to the kind of facilities you get in an International Hotel for the same value, this hotel is not a value for money. Not a good choice for food. The overall experience of my stay is below my expectations and little depressing. The dine area is not a good location with in hotel.
ID-1285	Nice place for staying if you have work in orgadam and MRV. Quite convenient and may be the best place in that area. Breakfast spread was superb and for dinner as well the variety of foods available for buffet was quite elaborate. On the top of Wi-Fi was good
ID-1286	In short, worth for money. An amazing experience and I definitely liked the breakfast buffet as complementary one. Also the rooms are very spacious and everything is perfect. It will be good if they club buffet dinner with some more tariff.
ID-1287	Great stay near industrial hub of oragadam. Beautiful room and facilities. Breakfast was classy. Definitely recommend for stay in both club and deluxe rooms. Hopefully prices are made competitive and more catchy for non business customers.
ID-1288	Didn't liked the food either lunch or dinner.The fitness center is for namesake, have no equipment and trainer. Vary far from airport. Didn't find any good reason to travel so far for ITC brand. Thanks
ID-1289	I hate to have a food, there was no proper food preparation, kindly change the food module and the people are nothing cared about the preparation I feel I lost 3500rs but the stay and views impressed but do please change the food.
ID-1290	In general our stay was comfortable.
ID-1291	Booked this hotel because they advertised with the view. Picture in the internet looked completely different from the small and shabby room they gave us after we insisted on a view.
ID-1292	"Very bad rooms and bed was smelling bathroom taps not working etc
Bad experience"
ID-1293	Good hotel at the best location with affordable rates. Courteous and helpful staff. The food is good and the service is pleasant. The staff is very honest and they know why I am thankful for their honesty.
ID-1294	Throughout night it was noisy because of aircraft landing. The windows are poorly insulated.
ID-1295	Nice very good cant complain.
ID-1296	Everything was very good in the hotel. The room price was reasonable in the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers. The activities were not available in the hotel. There was no delay in check in and checkout at the booking office of the hotel. The hotel was value for money.
ID-1297	The complimentary breakfast was provided by the hotel.
ID-1298	It was nice stay for me in this hotel because the location of the hotel was near to the city only. And staffs was also do operative. But manager of this hotel was tottaly good because I did not face any problem in this hotel related to the service food or anything. For me it was value for money. And if I will come in this city so I will stay here only

ID-1306	The staff at the hotel's front desk were absolutely fantastic. Location is very nice. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. I lost my iPhone and the front desk staff helped me to call all the places I have visited. Bed was super comfortable, room is spacious and clean. It was clean and beautiful - and the water pressure in the shower and tub is fantastic. Great hotel for business or pleasure.

Service of the hotel is also good. Clean hotel. Rooms are good and clean. Staff behavior is also very good. Overall, the hotel is good and affordable.
ID-1309	great
ID-1310	Clean, functional place to stay. Not quite as close to Marina Beach as it states, as we found out when we started walking! Still walkable distance though. Lots of little shops + market stalls around but did not see obvious places to eat. Not an obvious area for foreign tourists to stay as we did not find any other tourists in the area. This is not a problem for us but might be to others.
ID-1311	front desk staffs are really good,they don't have a kitchen so everything you eat comes from outside restaurants...
ID-1312	Crowded Area, plenty of shops nearby. Traffic is very heavy. Wifi password keeps changing everyday. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are average. Worth the price though.
ID-1313	I booked this hotel because of 3 star rating but it is not worth to 3 star. The location of the hotel is in very crowded place and maintenance of hotel is not upto the mark. The bed sheet was dirty, the chair cloth was broken looks 2nd handle, the bathroom has broken wall. Overall not worth for money.
ID-1314	I will recommend and prefer to stay in future ... Good service and good staffs
ID-1315	Rooms are very small. But all the amenities are available in room. Free breakfast, newspaper, WiFi. But location of the hotel is in Mirshahibpet market. As it is in a market area so the hotel front area is a little bit congested. Good for short stay.
ID-1316	The hotel staff are rude and not at all friendly. When asked for breakfast they denied later after showing reservation which says breakfast included they said it will be serve @11am. They service sucks big time. Even after reservation, they made us to wait for 1hrs to get room keys. Don't be fooled with other rating. Total the experience was pathetic will never stay in this hotel anytime in future.
ID-1317	"I really happy about this hotel stay. the hotel is close to the most visited place in the chennai city.
over roll I'm happy and I'll recommend to my friends."
ID-1318	Excellent staff and facilities, great value for the money. Enjoyed my two day stay here.
ID-1319	I like to stay here overnight when travelling via Chennai to or from further south in Tamil Nadu .
ID-1320	"Above average

Morning buffet was averge for 5 star hotel. 

Smoking smell thru out the corridor."
ID-1321	Good nice hotel. Clean and comfortable
ID-1322	Rooms quite alright, bathrooms clean, bed mattresses out of shape i.e. Curved in the torso region & need changing as they are not comfortable to sleep in, food average, i would not mind staying here again but enough reasons for making it a better place to be in -  surely. 6/10.
ID-1323	Really hotel staff is not experienced , on check in I was told its king size bed but in room it's twins and got excused , sorry we are fully booked , no person in hotel to help you with your luggage and also the time take your luggage to put in taxi , no people , no much opotions in breakfast
ID-1324	Very present stay.
ID-1325	We stayed one night because we had a stop over in Chennai. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. We had heard a lot of mixed reviews about the hotel but we didn't have any issues.
ID-1326	good
ID-1327	"Spacious Rooms, Clean Bathrooms
The services is the one of the worst in this categories of hotels
Check In Time tooooo long.
In room Service Pathetic
Breakfast you will not get anything, looks like you have lost in market, Staffs are not helpful.
Guest Service - No response (phone keeps on ringing, no one to attend)
Check Out - Pathetic,"
ID-1328	We were surprised at just how good it is.  We loved it, and would certainly stay there if we ever return to Chennai.  I congratulate the managers and staff for a job well done.
ID-1329	Very decent staff. Helping nature was good and very near to Chennai central and park station. Overall, good and very safe hotel to stay!!! Market area was also close to the place. You can get taxi or auto easily.
ID-1330	Location is very good. It is near to Chennai Central Railway Station only 6 to 7 minutes walkable distance. It is an average hotel and function of the front office also is also rated as average. Regarding the food it is good and room is good but bathroom is so small.
ID-1331	There were activities arranged by this hotel. The best part of the hotel was cleanliness and service. The food was good with quality and quantity. I would recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers.
ID-1332	The lady receptionist was acting like she owns the bell hotel and said BIG NO for everything that we requested for. She said finally this is not for serving customers at all since you booked from make my trip. Very very bad experience just because of her
ID-1333	It's nice place to go and enjoy, it has everything it. It's one of the best place I went. I really enjoyed it. There is no drawback in the hotel. You can really enjoy the place to see. It need to add some entertainment game with it so, all will love the place.
ID-1334	1.1111E+249
ID-1335	One of the worse hotel. I have seen in my life specially for single room. Railway track nearby, so whole night you will not sleep also AC noisy. Worse hotel and total wastage of money. I will not advice single person to take room in this hotel. No silence and renovation not upto mark. Totally they made me fool.
ID-1336	Hotel rooms are good. Front desk is staff is good. Difficult to communicate to restaurant staff. Food service pathetic also IRD. Acceptable overall. Nothing great. Location is good. If service improved it can be a good hotel. Rooms are not that great facilities can be improved.
ID-1337	The hotel was located in the city. The appearance of the hotel was good. I had faced the difficulty in check in and checkout process. All amenities were provided in the room but TV was not working condition in the room. The behaviour of the staffâ€™s was not friendly in the hotel. The food quality was good in the hotel. The activity was not arranged by the hotel.
ID-1338	Rooms are very neat and clean. Staff is cooperative and friendly in behaviour. Hotel is located nearby Chennai central station but I recommend to take taxi for approaching hotel. Food is very delicious. Only thing where I'm not satisfied is that they are providing limited access to wifi. Overall, I give 4 out of 5.
ID-1339	Food service is good and complimentary breakfast was also good. Room service is excellent. Rooms are neat. Yeah people can choose the hotel and main reason to stay is nearby railway station and market area. Overall, to stay in this hotel is good but parking area is not comfortable for four wheeler.
ID-1340	The hotel was super convenient; management was friendly, efficient and effective. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all friends travelling to Chennai. Rooms were spacious, bathrooms clean with quality toiletries and breakfasts were sumptuous.
ID-1341	Good value for money. Very neat well appointed room had a very comfortable stay. Very near to city centre. The room had a great view of the sea shore. I would recommend for long stays too as you have washing machine and all cooking range.
ID-1342	The hotel is clean, convenient and good value for money. Staff are courteous and helpful. However, they need more training to be efficient. They are prone to mistakes in taking service and food requests. Buffet breakfast needs improvement. Was my third trip.
ID-1343	Too much good experience with hospitality, cleanliness, facility and privacy and good value for money... To keep mind relaxing... Keep it up... Wanna visit other properties by this Somerset people.
ID-1344	Food is expensive .. Other than that a great hotel . .
ID-1345	I am deaf. Bar is closed and Restaurant is okay ... It should be more decoration as beautiful. I enjoyed swimming top floor and weather is good
ID-1346	Very Good Service Apartment which gives you a feel of Hotel. Facilities, staff and cleanliness was good. Restaurants can have more options. Locality of the hotel is good. Hotel should provide Valet parking for the cars. Overall experience was good.
ID-1347	Overall, it was good experience. Rooms were spacious and they were kept very clean and tidy. Room service was good. Good dining experience. With swimming pool and lot more. Located close to malls, temple, beach etc. It makes travel more easy. Must visit.
ID-1348	Very good hotel at reasonable price, Location is good, food is excellent and rooms are spacious, Staff is friendly but had taken a long time to check-in than usually happens, Very close to beach and have nice view of the beach from the hotel, prefer for weekend stays with family.
ID-1349	Regular stay nothing to write home about. During morning breakfast they ask you to go to reception to collect breakfast coupon. First time I have come across this weird practice. If you order a drink in the room the waiters want you to settle the bill by cash as it cannot be posted in the bill. Most unusual and unfriendly.
ID-1350	This is excellent hotel for long term stay and also for family. Lobby is very clean and good. Breakfast is OK. I really enjoyed the shower and the Bathroom is excellent. Good view from my room. I recoded this hotel for all types of stays.
ID-1351	Worth staying, value for money it give all facilities available in any apartment do stay once in your life time
ID-1352	It's one of those places that's the very definition of home away from home. And even better, home that has lovely people helping you out with even the tiniest of tiny things. The staff is just wonderful - Vinod, Prashanth, Ashok.
ID-1353	This is an awesome property very well maintained and the service is matching to there standards. The infinity pool is excellent with roof top jacuzzi and we'll equipped gym to take care of your health. Overall excellent.
ID-1354	The hotel was located near the iyyappan temple and the surrounding by sea views. The hotel was very good condition for the best price. I really enjoyed the location very well. It was in very hot of the city centre and the service was excellent and value for money.
ID-1355	Excellent and renovating stay. Nice room. Great roof top pool and hygienic gym. Food could be better. Also the rates for repeat customer need to be considered. I wanted to extend my stay but due to rates I couldn't continue.
ID-1356	Good, well connected to the city, value for money deals
ID-1357	At best I would rate it 4 star. The Restaurant is ok but again nothing like 5 star.  The rooftop pool is very good and that's  the reason I gave a 4 for facilities.  At night you can hear the dogs barking in the street below.  Outside the hotel its pretty grim with a lot of rubbish left lying around.
ID-1358	Excellent place to stay in Chennai. Almost a 5 star hotel and the staff is excellent. Good buffet breakfast
ID-1359	the buffet breakfast was not up to the 4 star category.
ID-1360	Washroom was stinking .. House keeping were not active in their job .. They were pretty slow .. Like the pool ..
ID-1361	"Lovely few days stay at the Somerset. Rooftop swimming pool was fab. The breakfast at both attached restaurants was varied and lovely to have freshly made parathas!
Although watch out for the evening buffet -well over priced.
Room was great with everything you'd want if you were staying for a long period.
Staff were polite and helpful.
We'd certainly recommend the Somerset!"
ID-1362	Hotel and facilities are good. But checkin staff was very rude and arrogant. Was not welcoming, and was brusque with the paperwork. Didn't inform us of breakfast timings and so we missed it inadvertently.
ID-1363	Repeat customer. Very accomodative with late checkout request.
ID-1364	Stayed there for 2 days with family.  Hotel was very clean, comfortable and comparable to international hotel chains. Would definitely stay there again.
ID-1365	Descent security check, Warm welcome, good escort to the room and briefing, nice breakfast,other usual comforts.on the whole I enjoyed my stay. Thank you
ID-1366	"Air conditioning will need further maintenance. For a 5 star hotel my room was very musty and needed to be changed. In addition, the temperate gauges did NOT work on my air condo and thus the room was freezing.

For events, the staff was really good and cooperative"
ID-1367	Really enjoyed the Japanese and Chinese restaurants, menu and food were excellent. Rooms were clean and quiet. Used the shuttle service everyday and was very easy. Will stay again next time I am in Chennai for work.
ID-1368	I had a bad experience and will not visit this hotel again
ID-1369	"Very comfortable, there was an excellent selection of breakfast and dinner. Watch out for overpriced bottles of water though! 

The staff were extremely helpful. 

 Lovely outdoor swimming pool - but very dark in the evenings - could do with better signage and lighting."
ID-1370	"Hotel is not a 5 starts hotel anymore.
The neighborhood is in construction so you can't get out by walking.
The hotel has a ballroom so they have parties every night and you can hear it in the room (7th floor).
Breakfast is mostly Indian, so if you don't like Indian food you're in trouble.
The free WI-Fi is lousy"
ID-1371	Over all its great and pleasant services from entrance
ID-1372	My fifth stay at the hotel for business. Rooms are great and the restaurants are excellent although not cheap. The room service menu is very good though and reasonably priced. The best part about the hotel is the staff who are very friendly and always helpful.
ID-1373	enjoyable
ID-1374	Most impressive service by staff in all areas. Good restaurants and fitness center. Beautiful hotel. Love the creative way the bathroom is set up that makes it both beautiful and functional. Love the many shelves in room and bathroom. However, the grout in the shower area looks like it needs some deep cleaning. Still, had a wonderful time at the hotel.
ID-1375	"The linens were smelling bad, and the elevators had a pungent odour. The housekeeping was not up to par of a 5 star hotel. They didn't clean the rooms regularly, I had a big argument with the housekeeping manager.

Doorman Syed and K. Subramani from Bell Services made my stay comfortable, even with these ordeals.."
ID-1376	"Stayed at the Hyatt in Chennai for the first time and was a refreshing change from the other hotels in the city.
Great rooms , brilliant food and the location could nt be better."
ID-1377	We had a great experience  STAYING IN THE HOTEL when we had visited Chennai for a short stay
ID-1378	"The cleanliness was appreciated.
The hotel is also well situated in the center of town and shopping area."
ID-1379	The hotel facilities are really good.The buffet breakfast is really taste and good varieties.
ID-1380	This hotel is in good location, but room services and cleanliness leaves lot to expect.
ID-1381	Very happy with my stay at Radha Regent. Very friendly hotel staff, facilities and the buffet was excellent with lots of variety.
ID-1382	We a family of 3 stayed for a day at Radha Regent, The Room size was ok.The toilet was good,The extra bed provided was a ramshackle piece.The Breakfast was splendid and the staff highly professional.Parking was hassle free.
ID-1383	Good
ID-1384	The location next to bus stop on bangalore to chennai route was what drew us to this motel.  It is quite nice inside.  The breakfast buffet was amazingly good with lots of Indian and Continental breakfast items.
ID-1385	"Hotel is simply good
But booking through expedia has made it miserable.
Very poor communication. 
Inthr hotel wifi is poor."
ID-1386	Satisfied with hotel cleanliness, staff support and breakfast.
ID-1387	The rooms were spacious and breakfast really good. Felt like spending some more time but had to rush for some commitments. The resto-bar has a classic set-up. Didn't quite look out for the gym. Planning to stay here in future when travelling with family.
ID-1388	Excellent hotel. Very good hotel at peak location. Service is excellent including 24 hours room service. Good ambience, complimentary breakfast is awesome with large variety of items. 100% I am satisfied.
ID-1389	Had a good time. Worth of money the ambience excellent and attentive service by staff. Varriety of food option and bars and security and safety standards very high. Laka
ID-1390	Hotel room is just average. Washroom was not cleaned at the time of check in. Would not recommend. Gym was average, overall not value for money. Very old property not upgraded at all.
ID-1391	Very good hotel at peak location. Service is excellent including 24 hours room service. Good ambiance, complimentary breakfast is awesome with a large variety. However the room facilities can be better, that would be like icing on the cake. All over very pleasant stay.
ID-1392	I stayed in this hotel on 28 June 2016. Stay was nice. Service was excellent. Breakfast menu was good with lots of variety for veg and non veg. Hotel location is also easy to locate. Overall experience is good and I will recommend to stay in this Hotel.
ID-1393	Stayed only 10 hours... Good experience. The break-fast is excellent... Especially hospitality in restaurant ( Breakfast) is good. Even though it is complementary they value their customers Only one thing which is not changing in India... The reception people start calling from 11 O clock for check out... Every one knows we have to check out at 12 noon... At least start calling after 12 if gets delayed.
ID-1394	Friendly staff with excellent breakfast. The only draw back was the music at Geoffrey's was too loud and conversing was next to impossible. Nice concept of smokers and non smokers room as generally in a room where a person smokes the room smells of tobacco.
ID-1395	It was a very good stay. We enjoyed our stay. The ambient and facilities were good. The food was good and the services were prompt. But they would have added Business news papers availability for the guest to keep them abreast of business developments and current business news. Overall it is very good.
ID-1396	cvpisfivfsgfofgfogfaomfmgoimfdogfdogfdojgofjdgjfajgfisjgmfvkmfkdmvfmgifmgiofamvmf,vmlfmvofmvofmvofvmfmvofmvmfmvfmvmfmlifmgmflgfgagfkgksfdkgl;kflgkskg;laskg;lskgksgk;skag;skgs;kgksdf;kkdskfdskfkdskf;dlskf;ldksf;kds;fkdskfkds;kf;sdkf;daskfkds;fk;dslkfdskf
ID-1397	Rooms need some refurb as it looks old and the toilet need to have proper bathing space. Though it is not in the centre of the city it is easily accessible. Food is OK. Other amenities are good.
ID-1398	Very good hotel. Nice service. One of the best hotel and well trained employees. Excellent food. Really delighted experience for two days. I had stayed with family. My son really enjoyed during stay in this hotel.
ID-1399	Nice place to stay with family at reasonable price. Food is really delicious. Rooms are very neat and clean and the place is really pleasant. WiFi facility is good. Value for money. Always my first choice in Chennai is Radha regent.
ID-1400	I liked it very much. I recommend my friends and relatives to book room in your hotel. Food was very delicious. I like buffet system. Free breakfast idea is very nice and attractive yummy dishes.
ID-1401	Though I have stayed in several Sarovar Hotel across India. This was my very 1st stay at Radha Regent Chennai and overall experience was good. Location and hospitality was excellent. And service and cleanliness of the room was good. I will prefer Radha Regent for future stays and refer to my friends to Radhika regency.
ID-1402	I have stayed at the radha many times due to its location for my business. The rooms are run down and basic with need of updating. The noise level at night due to live music within the hotel is annoying but is over by midnight. That said the service is always exceptional and the food in the lobby lounge is also excellent.
ID-1403	It is an ideal place for the price. Good restaurant. Very close to textile & jewellery hub of T Nagar. Other good veg restaurants are also close by. Though it is a small building easy to locate. I recommend strongly for frequent travellers.
ID-1404	Queens way park was good hotel to stay for corporate people, but inside staff are not much educated and unprofessional behavior. Complementary breakfast are not much good, quality of food also not much worth. Inside room was good and cleanliness, I loved it. Overall hotel was below average and costwise to stay at this point of time OK.
ID-1405	Located in prime area. Budget hotel with clean and neat rooms. Food is very good. However non availability of flexi check out (12 noon strictly followed) and very few staff to assist in room service is only problem. Very good hotel for short stay though.
ID-1406	The Hotel is good and clean. But the breakfast spread is poor. The Food quality is average and no much options to choose from
ID-1407	Everything is Excellent ... Location - Heart of the City, Food - Awesome, nice Hotel, Easy Connectivity, Prices also reasonable, worth. Good Hygiene
ID-1408	Was on a business travel, good hotel.. Stay was good except the breakfast served.. Not much variety & WiFi was slow. Beverage kept in Mini Bar way too costly. Overall as it was close to the place I wanted to visit, & just one day.. No issue.
ID-1409	It was pleasant stay, rooms are decent, service was very good. Very good location too. Only one issue I have faced was - Internet availability for first 2 days was issue. Once I spoke to reception, they have fixed it on next day. Overall its value for money.
ID-1410	Good place. Good food and good service. Everything at the hotel is worth for the money spent. Overall I had a great stay at Queensway Park. I will definitely come back again for a stay at the hotel.
ID-1411	No cleanliness, rooms full of mosquitoes, pathetic service, OK food. Never suggest to go to this hotel. Very limited options of breakfast and dinner. Mediocre quality of food
ID-1412	Good one, recommended. Liked the hotel and their services. Hotel location is also ok. The rooms are comparatively bigger than the tariff. Cleanliness is also good. Staff are well mannered and services are good. Breakfast is also good and room service as well.
ID-1413	The staff is really nice. The rooms are good and it is in a good location as it is near many stores. The breakfast served is also good. It is good for both family and business travellers. I would recommend it to my friends and family. It is worth the money paid.
ID-1414	Overall a decent place to stay. The location is perfect, easy to find. The rooms are also good. The only disadvantage is the restaurant. It doesn't have a lot of variety to choose from. Even the place is pretty small. However the taste was very good. Hotel staff is also courteous and made it a very good experience for us.
ID-1415	Good one, recommended. Liked the hotel and their services. Hotel location is also ok. The rooms are comparatively bigger than the tariff. Cleanliness is also good. Staff are well mannered and services are good. Breakfast is also good and room service as well.
ID-1416	Value for money for sure. Very courteous front desk & all staff. Clean room. Everything good. Would surely recommend. Good for family as well as for business travellers. Breakfast (included) was good enough for the price of the room. It's restaurant is though little bit highly prices but not very expensive. Location is good in T. Nagar. Also railway station walking distance. Overall a good experience.

ID-1418	Not worth 5k for a night. 5 star hotels in chennai are around the same price. Not at all worth the price at this hotel.
ID-1419	It's a decent hotel located close to Marina beach and a few good restaurants, very friendly staff.
ID-1420	Excellent location with best vegetarian food available in the city. Easily accessible in the heart of city. Regarding WiFi it's bit slow and room cleanliness is bit average. Can improve a little bit on these two aspects.
ID-1421	Hotel is very neat and clean, breakfast was very tasty and lot of varieties were there. Staff is very polite. Its a pure vegetarian hotel but nearby we are having good option to have non veg. Two to 3 malls are nearby only.
ID-1422	Except for Location, there is no value for money. Poor Service. No hot water. Not provided proper linen. Despite complaint to Front Desk, no action was taken, No alternative room was provided. Due to proximity to US Consulate, we have stayed there. Else a Strict NO.
ID-1423	Hotel is very nice with pleasant ambiance.. Rooms are very good.. Only problem is with hot water.. We will not get hot water continuously.. Have to cal them many times and after half an hr we get them.. Complimentary breakfast provided is not of good quality.. Apart these two it is very nice hotel to stay.. It is very close to beach and also malls.
ID-1424	Nice hotel
ID-1425	From airport and central station reachable distance service and neatness is good location is excellent no pollution calm and silent hotel rent affordable
ID-1426	Good neat and clean. Centrally located near to railway station, near to beach. Veg hotel and worth staying for the tariff. Rooms are good and near to mylapore temple. For family stay is also good. Good restaurant with only veg. No egg also they make. Pure veg
ID-1427	Nice place to stay, center of Chennai, parking facilities good, cleanliness is good more is needed, noisy at night, light was coming inside the room while sleeping curtains need to prevent light entry needs to be done, little expensive for the facilities, food for breakfast, more needs to be done.
ID-1428	Too good. Centrally located, clean rooms, fantastic hospitality, uber and OLA cabs can reach easily, beaches are just 2 kms away, decent locality, good food, fine dine and bar, awesome service, cool ambience etc....
ID-1429	The hotel is located very ideally which makes it easily accessible for people travelling for work. The hotel rooms are decent and clean. Service needs improvise though the staff are friendly. Booking the room through make my trip was a brilliant experience and with the fantastic offers the deal seemed very appealing.
ID-1430	This was my second visit to DP. My first one was good so I booked the same hotel for my 2nd visit. But this time the experience was pathetic. There was cockroaches on the dining table at Olives. The toilet sink was open and stinking every time the tap was open, no hot water on both days, the bathroom door doesn't lock, corridor doesn't smell fresh. Dont ever order their in -room food. Its ultra expensive and not good.
ID-1431	Food facility was available at this hotel. The food quality was good. The hotel was nearby the mall. The behaviour of staff's and executive was good. I had visited this hotel with my family. Parking facility was available at this hotel. Gym facility was available at this hotel. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout service was done on time. Wi-Fi service was available at this hotel. The hotel was value for money.
ID-1432	Deccan Plaza
ID-1433	. .........................................................................................................................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...............,,,,,,,,,,,...............,,,,,,,,,,,
ID-1434	Good one. But not so good for the money which you are paying there. Especially for the food. But service was good and room was very good. I will recommend this hotel to others as it's got a good location and easily accessible.
ID-1435	I booked this hotel for 1 night on 18th May, the hotel and its staff are very well mannered and helpful, in all a pleasant stay, thanks to Makemytrip and Deccan Plaza and veg breakfast buffet is very good, rooms are OK. Cons:- The bed-sheet had stains which was changed on informing.
ID-1436	"NOT VERY HAPPY  WITH  HOTEL     STAFF VERY GOOD

VERY CLOSE TO  US CONSULATE

VERY CLOSE TO RESTATURANTS

NEAT LOCATION"
ID-1437	Ok good
ID-1438	"Hotel is located in a central place. Nearby shopping place.

Hotel staff are friendly and services are good.

Hotel is maintained well."
ID-1439	I checked in late and I had my visa interview the next day, I requested them for a late checkout around 3-4, since my flight was in the evening but the staff was so rude that they refused me on the face for the same. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. I had to sit in their lobby until I was supposed to leave for my flight. The room was also not so clean and hygienic
ID-1440	Cleanliness of room,/hotel, Hotel location
ID-1441	Very good location, ideal for US Visa interview and roaming around.
ID-1442	Stay at the Hotel is satisfactory. We are not aware the Hotel has 24 hours checkout policy. Only on 3rd day morning they have informed that we should checkout at 8.30 am and we felt something strange. As per their desire we checked out at 9.00am.
ID-1443	Nice Hotel.  Excellent helpful Staff. Pleasant Stay
ID-1444	Great Experience
ID-1445	Best place to stay in Chennai. Friendly staff. Wish they have 24 hours check out policy, had to pay extra money to stay extra 4 hours in spite of staying and paid for 3 nights. Little bit flexibility would help international passengers flying in and out of Chennai. K
ID-1446	Always up to the exacting standards of Taj hotels, especially in India. This one feels very corporate though. Rooms are a bit small â€“ even though we had what was supposedly a club room. Service was excellent â€“ great staff, especially at breakfast, always at hand to assist. Breakfast was truly awesome. The Taj hotels we have stayed at (in India) simply have the best breakfasts in the world â€“ no other hotel group comes close
ID-1447	Very nice hotel with excellent accommodations and service. Don't miss the pool - it is a peaceful paradise in the middle of a busy city. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and that our stay was perfect.
ID-1448	A pleasant stay. Staffs are friendly and polite. Clean and comfortable
ID-1449	It was good
ID-1450	"Hotels.com should advise customers of other charges .
I was not aware of a luxury tax and other charges which pushed the price considerably ."
ID-1451	In this Hotel everything is catered for. There is no effort spared by the staff to ensure your stay is perfect.
ID-1452	"Staff are very well trained and quite helpful and not helpful to the point of being annoying.
At check in, I asked to first see the room, I was shown a room that seemed small and not updated, I was shown a room that has been renovated which turned out to be perfect !!"
ID-1453	A top class hotel in the heart of Chennai with a diverse set of amenities, sure to please visitors from all parts of the world.
ID-1454	Rude and unfriendly staff behaviour, will never book again to spoil my trip in a bad place. The staff and management are just dumb and the don't have any aticate and policies that can help a client in a helpful manner. Will never visit this place again and make sure none of my friends will.
ID-1455	Ms. Shobana at the front desk and mr Sivaraman at the South Indian restaurant were extremely thoughtful. The room was comfortable. The pastry shop in the lobby is brilliant. Very warm and courteous environment.
ID-1456	It was a superb hotel. The appearance of the hotel was good. The reception of the staffâ€™s was very friendly in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was not provided in the hotel. The lunch and dinner was not included in the package. I had visited this hotel for business purpose. I would not recommend this hotel to upcoming travellers. I donâ€™t have any suggestion for this hotel. The overall experience of the hotel was excellent.
ID-1457	Staff made us feel at home. We were always greeted with little surprises like goodies for my child, a soveniour for my wife. Room service and cleanliness were of top quality. We also had a great dinning experience in southern spice.
ID-1458	Hotel was very accommodating and front desk staff, security personnel were good and pleasant to deal with. The hotel's offering on food is very limited and choice of international cuisine needs improvement. All staff were very courteous, polite and welcoming. The hotel is clean and well maintained.
ID-1459	The hotel was located in center of the city. The taste of food was good. You can feel the warmth of the staff. While checking out my card was not working, the staff helped me regarding that and their politeness impressed me. Everything was perfect, except arrival experience

ID-1470	"Trivago listed the hotel as near to MEPZ but it was actually ~20kms away.  But no complaints. it took us only 45 min in peak hours and 30 min in non-peak to and fro office.

Good overall experience. There is no lift and that's a big dampener. Good Wi-Fi connection and hassle-free too. Good Food.

The location and congestion around the location was inconvenient."
ID-1488	We stayed one night at this hotel on transit from colombo to londo. the air conditioning in the whole floor and in our room was badly defective resulting in significant dampness throughout this part of the building. we felt this hotel was basically uninhabitable.

ID-1493	One of the best hotels in Chennai. Ambience is good but I do not think it is well received by visitors. Never plan to travel Auto's in Chennai. You travel experience will not be good. Hotel also providing shuttle services also when required. Service is fabulous. You will love it.
ID-1494	Everything was very good in this hotel. The activity was available at the hotel. I had visited this hotel for official trip with my family.
ID-1495	"We had a marvelous stay in Chennai at courtyard Marriott. Wonderful interiors, very good service and some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's Esenin Restaurant for the blini and caviar and some exquisite salmon dishes. Very reasonably priced too for a luxury hotel.
ID-1496	Hotel staff, especially at Paprika restaurant were very cordial and helpful. They went out of their way to help us.
ID-1497	bathroom ciel was leaking with water. not a good option to stay in chennai
ID-1498	The hotel is very well situated although the latest work by the Chennai metro has made the approach a little cumbersome and also in traffic time can take a few extra minutes to reach. The hotel has sniffer dogs to sniff cars and seems to but very security conscious. The rooms are nice and the food also good. It has the class of the marriott chain.
ID-1499	A fine day, I went for a dinner, it is really good the way they served the quality of the food and the taste is also very fine. The positive is the valet parking and the negative of the hotel is if a food got over it takes some time for them to fill it back.
ID-1500	One of the nice hotel compared to other hotel. Room is so spacious, food is so tasty and delicious. Bed is comfortable and mattress are so good, it is near to city, all facilities are available. Hot water facility is also available, room is so clean and appearance of the hotel is good.

ID-1522	average amabiance and comfort of lobby,breakfast room
ID-1523	"Barbeque option nice especially  if we do not like spicy food.
Shopping mall opposite very  interesting."
ID-1524	excellent experience, courteous staff, clean and nice ambience, good food
ID-1525	The good - Very nice hotel building, nice room, clean, good TV channels, not bad gym, breakfast good but same every day - ok if staying only 1 or 2 nights only. The bad - Extract fan in bathroom didn't work, Some of the front desk staff were not friendly, tried to overcharge on extra bed when already included in price, only Indian food good from room service avoid western food.
ID-1526	Easy access to shopping, mall and transportation to the city and airport. well maintained facility. hotel room maintenance staff is friendly and helpful. Check in process could be improved with friendly staff at the counter especially during late evening.
ID-1527	Good place to live, but was very expensive. Food was good had lot of varieties. I would recommend only if the nightly price is little less.close to everywhere. Shopping, good food spots, easy to commute around. I stayed for 4 days. Had it been cheaper in price it would have been better.
ID-1528	I stayed at the Green Park Hotel for 5 nights and found the overall experience very satisfying.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good and it was great to have the Forum Mall right next door with no major roads to cross.  I would easily recommend it to others.
ID-1529	I stayed for a day in aloft and the food was amazing.. Liked the room as well but could have been better as it was short of pillows and towels. All the other basic amenities are present and would give 4 star for the food alone and 3 star for the overall, experience.
ID-1530	Nice hotel. In midst of busy it corridor... Well located... Clean... Nice breakfast... Rooms though are quiet small are well maintained... Well equipped gym area... And pool drawback is no driver dormitory.
ID-1531	Good services. Good environment. Rooms are very clean and safe. All varieties items are good. Aloft hotel cost are good in comparison of any services. Suppose we want any facilities they provide on time. Aloft Hotel cost is less in comparison of other hotel.
ID-1532	Aloft - standard not maintained. Not very clean. The bedspread had stains... Aloft is an international chain and their standard abroad is completely different and is on a different scale. A lot needs to be done to maintain the same standard. An okay experience but not worth the money and the brand.
ID-1533	It was a very good experience staying at your hotel. All facilities are perfect and ambiance is very good. Service is very good. Food quality is excellent. I enjoyed my stay looking forward to stay here in future.
ID-1534	Wonderful stay in Aloft. Food was good. Nice hospitality services. Breakfast was free and was of good quality. Room was clean and decent one. Hotel staff was also very helpful. I stayed there for one day and it was a nice and great experience for me.
ID-1535	My experience of this hotel was superb with excellent hospitality, good food and great ambiance. A perfect place to stay if you are travelling with family. Comfortable rooms, extremely supportive staff who take care of all your needs. Surely gonna visit again!
ID-1536	Good and pleasant stay this onward journey in my home state and I greet them to keep all the time best .
ID-1537	Very good in hospitality services. I must thank to each and everyone who did service for my stay. Good food. Good room service. I have stayed there for 3 days and all the three days has been a good experience for me. Very wonderful stay in Aloft.
ID-1538	Overall the stay was good, though the room service was below expectation. When we requested the hair dryer to be replaced (which was out of order), it took them a cool half an hour to so. Some other room service request (for room slippers, towels etc) took quite awhile too. The reception seems to give a cold welcome which we did not expect from ALOFT, as we have stayed in other ALOFT hotels before and the welcome was warmer than here in OMR.
ID-1539	Great experience. I just visited the place for a little while for a get together with my office mates. Amazing ambiance and a super cool pub. Awesome food and drinks. The place is neat and clean. A good luxury experience. Service was great in-spite of the crowd with no delay.
ID-1540	I stayed in Aloft and was a good experience. The rooms were neat and tidy, spacious for double occupancy. Room service was prompt and good. Food was good especially the complimentary buffet breakfast. WiFi connection was also working fine. Overall a good hotel to stay.
ID-1541	Friendly staff but lack of process and quality visible everywhere. Food was fine for an average Indian guest, but my colleague didn't had any great choices. A bar with fewer options, housekeeping staff who needs multiple reminders, made the stay to the other side of expectations, especially to someone who is experienced with an Aloft stay in some other country.
ID-1542	Aloft is near the global hospital where we were admitted a relative and we stayed here for a night. It's a cozy place with a great restaurant called dot yum. We visited the restaurant and gorged on their lamb chops and chicken salad. Both were yum unfortunately our medical stay got extended and we had to shift to a service apartment. Will definitely drop in again on our next trip to Chennai.
ID-1543	It has refreshing look, definitely not a traditional style of hotel what we see elsewhere. If I stay near Sholinganallur, this is the place. I stayed nearly 1 month didn't feel boring. They do have attached bar and restaurant with nice food. It's a quite a place to relax from business schedule.
ID-1544	I always overlooked the funky lightings and the offbeat decor but one thing I can't get used to is the room itself. No storage space for clothes, odd shape of the room,the ac location which makes the room too cold or too hot and very ordinary service at the restaurant just makes it a bad place for business travellers.
ID-1545	"I like to stay here because the location has many options for eating and other shopping needs.

I have stayed many times here and things are perfect. At few points, I feel that it is little over priced.

Hotel is in excellent condition."
ID-1546	The hotel is modern hotel and the room was very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant. It is some distance from the airport and there is nothing around the hotel.
ID-1547	was really good :)
ID-1548	Experience was good. I couldn't spend much time at aloft as I have come for an official purpose. The ambience is very good in the hotel.
ID-1549	"Facilities: Modern; Value: Inexpensive; Service: Go the extra mile; Cleanliness: Delightful; 
overall excellent in location for price."
ID-1550	"Really so good
The quality of food has to be taken care of"
ID-1551	It was great pleasant and memorable experience for me during the stay at Le Royal Meridien Chennai. The staff and crew are very professional and friendly. Special thanks to the the manager who helped me in celebrating my specie day here at the Hotel.
ID-1552	Was a very pleasant stay, everything was super good from rooms to staffs to ambiance, food so forth !!!
ID-1553	Though hotel offers 24 hour stay for make my trip booking it is 12 noon highly objectionable. The price appears to be high for make my trip guests. Please contact them to remove the discrimination to make booking through make my trip more economical.
ID-1554	Not quite like a 5 star experience , It is barely at a 3 star standard at present. Needs to do a lot of Improvement
ID-1555	"It was a nice staying here at this hotel

I would stay at this hotel next time but I was annoyed that I had to pay for wifi service"
ID-1556	As we had booked hotel for different date by mistake and requested for prepone the booking for which MakeMyTrip has well accepted, but on personal visit request also Hotel Staff didn't supported.for which spent almost 1hour over phone with MakeMyTrip executive and in the hotel reception.
ID-1557	When I checked in last time, the service I received is very horrible. We stayed 2 person in a room. When we asked for water, they are on chargeable basis. Also @ nyte when we ordered food, they confirmed food is available and after half and hr i. e by 11:00 they are telling that, kitchen is closed. Food is not available. I
ID-1558	I had visited this hotel for official trip. The food quality was good. The activity was not available at the hotel. All amenities were provided in the room. The behaviour of staffâ€™s was good in this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers. I donâ€™t have any suggestion for this hotel.
ID-1559	Our stay at the hotel was very disappointing, on arrival the wifi was not working. The toilets are smaller than the cupboards. No other facility is available and cleanliness is also bad. The service for breakfast is great though and I appreciate that but for the rest I guess it was all a waste and unpleasant stay.
ID-1560	Located centrally. Value for money. I should specially appreciate Mr. Prabhakar at restaurant for breakfast. Superb service. I definitely like to stay again. I will recommend superior rooms which are really awesome. Good hospitality and front office response is good.
ID-1561	I have stayed in this hotel for a day but experienced very bad. The rooms are very small and not spacious and comfortable. The look from outside is good, but not hygienic one. Breakfast complementary but there is no variety available. The price is so high, but not worthy to stay. Can find a good hotel in the same surrounding at same cost. Overall, not so good experience with this hotel.
ID-1562	My flight to Chennai arrived in the middle of the night and I got to the hotel about 5.30am, realising I couldn't get into my room until midday. However the guy at the front desk let me have the room at 8am which I greatly appreciated.
ID-1563	It was nice experience of stay in hotel. Hotel is located at the heart of the city. Very close to the railway station and bus stand so it will save time & money. Complementary breakfast was delicious. Recommended for stay for business /leisure / to see the city.
ID-1564	this is very good and decent place in chennai, near airport.. all set when i have arrived. thanks much. will come back again )
ID-1565	There are lot of hidden charges in this hotel. I ended up paying around 50 % extra above the room rate in addition to the tax. I never stay back here.
ID-1566	Very near to airport. Staff are polite/
ID-1567	"Do not book this hotel. Got the worst room I have ever seen in a 5 star hotel in India

In the new room the faucet was loose and was ready to fall off

Avoid this hotel"
ID-1568	The hotel was almost k.The staff peple were responsible with their duties.All are doing there joke upto the mark,But only few buggs,Overall the room are well ventilated amd could find few more things that are not much used.Overall i feel good with this.Rooms are not that much clean.I enjoyed your hotel company but not that much.Overall i hope its a gud time in ur hotel
ID-1569	The carpet in the rooms and corridor need upgrade. Trash cans are full of rust and have holes in the bottom.
ID-1570	Superb staff, great food and amazing spa treatment. Love the lobby. Rooms are super spacious but needs a little brighter lights and more plug points. I was upgraded to a large room and my friends were in a different hotel and their room was modern but very small.
ID-1571	Cockroaches in the bathroom! Decent food and service.
ID-1572	THE APPEARANCE IS GOOD AND THE STAFF CO-OPERATION ARE VERY GOOD. AND THE FOOD NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED A LOT. ROOM SERVICE SHOULD BE IMPROVED WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH TV BUT THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT ATTEND ON TIME SO I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS. THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IN THE FRONT DESK ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE.
ID-1573	Shabby, musty rooms with cracked mirrors & washbasin. A rusted in-room electric kettle and an in-room controller that is on perpetual date 14 June.
ID-1574	very good hotel at a nice location.service is good and view are adorable.rooms are good and service is also very good.food is ok. staff are friendly.must visit this hotel once.welcome drink and staff behaviour was good.room service was also good.i like to visit this hotel once again in future.
ID-1575	The comfort Inn is really a comfortable hotel for the tourist's, it was amazing to stay in that hotel actually! Overall the infrastructure of the hotel was excellent and I am excited to stay there for the best service that they have done for me with group! I'm sure that I would like to be there for some other time.
ID-1576	We usually visit Bangalore once in every six months and we prefer comfort while staying for we always choose Comfort Inn which has good reception. Rooms are awesome with maximum facility. In a place like Bangalore, it is very difficult to get parking space but we get good parking lot. Restaurant is good, not much expensive. Overall, rating is very good.
ID-1577	 Value for money
ID-1578	I have stayed in Hotel Comfort Inn for couple of days. Its a very good facility in the heart of the city suitable for stay with family at reasonable rate. facilities and other arrangements are value for money. The have disciplined room service system. Lift facility is available. Overall, It was a nice experience for me at Hotel Comfort Inn, Bangalore
ID-1579	Everything was good and it was a peaceful stay. Food was extraordinary. Rooms are very clean and services were good as well.
ID-1580	This is a good option for business travelers in Chennai. It would have been even better if they had provided free airport pick up and drop off like Radisson
ID-1581	Hotel facilities are good, Staff at reception poor
ID-1582	Spacious rooms and good breakfast buffet. Pool is small. Beach facing rooms . Overall we had good stay
ID-1583	Bathrooms were not cleaned, Towels were old and dirty
ID-1584	"Hotel was clean, reception was welcoming though not courteous enough. Had to wait a lot for check out. Rooms were well furnished.
Breakfast menu was good and was tasty. All in all a good stay for short visit where you don't have to rely heavily on staff."
ID-1585	"I Booked a room with two twins.  I tried daily to get the twin beds; I was told they would call me repeatedly. No one called.    
The room was never vacuumed and they ran out of towels.
When I checked out they charged me taxes even though I paid for the rooms through Expedia. Now I have to be reimbursed for the double room taxes I paid.  This stay was difficult."
ID-1586	Hotel is Decent. The buffet quality and options has depreciated for the worse.
ID-1587	excellent
ID-1588	Efficient, functional hotel. Linen is clean but worn-off.  Staff is courteous and helpful but less than elegant. Slight change in the attitude of the property can make this place outstanding!
ID-1589	Functional. Not luxurious but quite efficient.
ID-1590	Easy walking distance to Mall with Cinema. Not many restaurants nearby, but fortunately the buffets at the hotel were very nice. No complaints. I would stay there again.
ID-1591	"Value: Great deal; 
No"
ID-1592	This was an unexpected horrible stay at this hotel. There was drilling going on all day on the roof due to construction work, there was a Bollywood movie set going on all day for three days that made movement in the hotel a pain, the hotel smelt musty and damp and the floors were sticky. The choice of food for non chilli eaters was non existent. I checked out and moved to a much better hotel.
ID-1593	Ac only in one mode. Can't adjust temp. House keeping has to improve. Lunch is really limited .curries not enough for provided food. Strange...
ID-1594	The Ambassador Pallava was close to where I had meetings and unexpectedly close to attractions like the national art museum. The property is beginning to show its age, but the food and service were excellent.
ID-1595	"I always stay here during my visits to Chennai and did so this time too.
All the staff from the door man, reception, concierge, house keeping, restaurant to the gym were extremely friendly and courteous and made me feel at home. as usual. The location was very convenient to get to all the places i had work at."
ID-1596	Average
ID-1597	"It was good
Very friendly staff at the check in and at the restuarants"
ID-1598	Breakfast service was Dhaba Style. Lacked sophistication and style. Not worth the price.
ID-1599	"Overall value for money.
Was surprised the room was big for the price I paid"
ID-1600	Location of The Ambassador Pallava is excellent, Rooms are very clean and excellent room service. Food is very good and hygienic. Friendly Staff. Travel and Tour information and help is available at Travel Desk. Banks and Hotels are nearby. I strongly Recommend.
ID-1601	I have travelled to most of the state in India and few countries abroad. To be very frank it is the best hotel according to me. The feeling of comfort and safety, a homely atmost here. Stay once and experience.
ID-1602	Very nice this hotel is near my home and I told my friend they stay in this hotel. Me also coming next time also this hotel, service is very nice. I applied many times in this hotel this hotel location is very good.
ID-1603	Though it was a short stay the overall experience was good. The AC wasn't effective, especially for people coming from Bangalore. Breakfast could have been better. All the staff were courteous. Can't do much about the ambience, couldn't go for morning walk.
ID-1604	It's located at nice place. Rooms are good but food is not that good and it is too costly too. Minimum things required in bathroom are not given. Toothpaste, brush and having kit is not given. They should have it.
ID-1605	The hotel is located in an ideal location, service is good. 24 hours coffee shop is nice. Stayed in 5th floor Rooms are good spacious.. All the basic requirements are available.. The pool is nice and huge.
ID-1606	The facilities are good. Value for money. TV has all channels in most languages. Room was clean and neat. Refrigerator working. Water kettle did not have auto cut off. AC was good. The bad thing was the restaurant for lunch and dinner, the buffet was overpriced, food was not great and was cold. The complimentary breakfast was good.
ID-1607	The location of the hotel is nice but the ambience is not good. They have to concentrate and the lift is not working by god's grace we escaped otherwise we would have trapped. They have to maintain and the breakfast is also not nice, they have to improve.
ID-1608	It was pleasant stay at Hotel Ambassador Pallava Chennai.. Good location and good service.. Breakfast was good.. Recommended for travellers with family or official purpose. This property is not far from railway station or bus station...
ID-1609	It's good and clean hotel and happy to stay here. Will suggest other to stay here and see the happiness of this hotel location, service and facilities.. It will be liked so much that a person wanna stay once again. Its good to stay with family too, I had stayed single but if I come back again here will be staying here only.
ID-1610	Ambience and hospitality is good. Interiors are good like any heritage hotel. Located in very convenient place to move around the city. People are good and ready to serve you as possible. But need maintenance of the bathrooms.
ID-1611	The location and all amenities are good but nearby hotels are more good and value for money. The hotel is old and had a rustic smell. Nearby good EA mall. Breakfast served was good. Stayed for a day only and then shifted to nearby good hotel.
ID-1612	Breakfast buffet is very average. Hotel and rooms has that very old look. It does not have that glamour look it had 30 years ago, when I stayed here last but at the rate I got my room on MMT and the location of the hotel... It was worth the money.
ID-1613	AC does not work in the hotel as it is a very old AC and beyond repair I guess. TV is also the old box styles TV with limited channels. All other facilities are good and service also is good. The location is a great advantage. Old style 4 star property.
ID-1614	Pretty average stay, Location and all was fine but then, booked the same basis reviews, that prove to be exaggerated! Checked in late night at around 11. 30 PM, ordered Dinner, it took almost 1 hour for delivery and the dish was not the one that was ordered. WiFi never worked. Breakfast average. Overall, if you are willing to compromise on certain aspects, I would say Value for Money.
ID-1615	Stay was comfortable. Its an old property and has a vintage feel to it. Staff is friendly and efficient. Pool is incredibly crowded, mainly kids, maybe due to vacation time.
ID-1616	"Although an old hotel with dated decor it is well maintained and the staff were courteous.
The food was good and the room was fine. We just stayed for a night but I would certainly reccommend this as a value for money hotel"
ID-1617	Got a good deal over the long weekend . Otherwise the rates are pretty much high. Clean rooms and the staff has been very helpful .
ID-1618	The staff at Asiana Place were really helpful! They were very accommodating and courteous and ensured our every needs were met. The rooms were well maintained and their breakfast spread was pretty decent. I enjoyed my stay at Asiana Place!
ID-1619	"Let's see:
Expedia booking didn't come thru so had to get it by calling,  etc 
Overall hotel is poor, lack of good facilities,  etc
Restaurant is not good.
Not to mention the cockroach that was running in Biryani rice in dinner buffet
I planned to stay for 3 days,  got out on first.
It is in such an excellent location and could be a great place to host corporate visitors but the place is just not good"
ID-1620	A decent hotel and the quality and service of the hotel is better. I stayed for one day. I would recommend this place for the people who would worry about the Taramani traffic since it is in the center you don't have to worry about the traffic. On the whole a decent hotel. I would give 3.5/5.
ID-1621	Hotel Asiana Place in Ascendas IT Park was an excellent experience. Very clean, excellent service and excellent food quality. Few negative points: There is no signboard of hotel outside, even if you pass it you will not come know there is hotel. In the locality there is no other restaurant if you want to dine out. Only option would be Ascenda's food court. This hotel is good for visitors of Ascendas IT park.
ID-1622	The location is absolutely fantastic beyond my understanding. Gave me a relaxed experience due to less connectivity of Mobile service, good ambience. Neat & tidy Rooms with approachable and polite staff. Food was good & tasty even. Quite and calm place to relax in between busy scheldule - lovely place to relax not feeling away from home.
ID-1623	Stay for 15 days in this hotel, located inside Ascendas IT park. Comfort level and services are on the best. In breakfast they have limited options but whatever they have taste good. Hotel is having one in house lounge as well entry for guest staying in hotel is free.
ID-1624	The outlook and the facilities of the hotel are good. Highly recommended for business trips. Clean rooms, good food and total value for money. The location of the hotel could have been better (for someone who was visiting Chennai for vacation getaway or beaches.
ID-1625	It was a nice hotel and value for money. Nice space, good ambiance, good breakfast and good service. You will definitely like this hotel. It was nice hotel value for money. Nice space, good ambiance, good breakfast, service is very good. You will definitely like this hotel.
ID-1626	"Quick check-in, clean room, quiet - away from major streets, decent breakfast and a not happening bar. I tried the dinner buffet and it is great value for money. The South Indian fare for breakfast - like methu vada and dosa is outstanding. 

Service is efficient and polite."
ID-1627	Found from makemytrip, the hotel located at the IP Park, the park is beautiful. The outlook and facilities are good, WiFi signal is not so good. The breakfast is not so perfect but it is good. The gym is not so good. Service is good but need to improve, totally, it is a little expensive but it is recommended if you want to find a hotel in the IT Park.
ID-1628	Chennai is a good place to stay. Only issue is for food for vegetarian for North Indian. Good place for sight seeing. Crocodile park is the good place to visit. You can also go for boating. Ocean beach can be a place for enjoyment. Hotel has limited food option.
ID-1629	The location of the hotel Asiana Palace is very good in the midst of the Ascendas IT Park. The ambiance is also good. The room service is OK but, not very good. The people are good but, take time to serve. The view from the room is also very good. Very good hotel for business purpose visit.
ID-1630	A nice hotel to stay, comparatively spacious rooms at reasonable cost. Located near the IT corridor. Good food and good service, courteous staff. Hotel room is very well-maintained with good amenities. Lavish and widespread breakfast and dinner. Free Wi-Fi. I found, the staff are attentive and helpful. Nice and comfortable hotel. About half an hour from the Airport.
ID-1631	The hotel was best suited for business trips. The hotel has nice location for corporate trips. The hotel was located near OMR Road. The rooms were nice and spacious. I like the attached bathroom as it was good too. The staff was well behaved and well dressed. The hotel has nice front office. I like the fast and timely services of this hotel. The hospitality was amazing.
ID-1632	Had been here for my official assignments. Hotel Location is awesome Very well located near official area. Hotel is located inside Ascendas IT Park, The staff is cooperative., The room decor is A Class . Food at restaurant is excellent. Free wifi & airport transfer.
ID-1633	One of the best place near by OMR road and great environment. Excellent room services, food taste was too good, rooms are very well-furnished and are in excellent condition. We have a wonderful parking area too. As the hotel is located in Ascendas IT Park, it is much suitable for corporate guys.
ID-1634	 well furnished rooms
ID-1635	One of the best places nearby OMR road, and great environment. Good place and room services, food taste was good, rooms are in excellent condition, and we have a wonderful parking area near the entrance, on time delivery of foods and services makes me to feel great to stay there for more hours.
ID-1636	Cold reception. Unfriendly and unreliable staff. Worst restaurant and in-room dining experience. Very poor food quality. Desolate location. A very 'plastic' feel to the entire features of common areas, rooms and restaurant. Will never recommend this place to anyone I know.
ID-1637	Asiana Place is an hotel setup built into a multistory commercial building , you would feel that in the design of the hotel and placement of its room in both interiors and exteriors, Nothing great about the typical .. a typical business travelers hotel where all you would be looking for a breakfast , gym , dinner and good night sleep. Its place inside a commercial complex so would not make sense for a family stay .. thanks
ID-1638	We liked the room, the cleanliness, extra bed for third person, size of the bed, restaurant on the 1st floor, staff, location, price/rate. I'll choose or recommend to my friends for sure.
ID-1639	It was a pleasant stay, only one challenge is Wi-Fi is horrible. Cleanliness and services are good. There is no landmark to reach this hotel.
ID-1640	Nice business hotel and very reasonable. Centrally located on a quiet street.
ID-1641	Nice air conditioning..good bathroom and a accessible location makes it a nice peaceful stay
ID-1642	Facilities & Room services are Below Average. Man power are very less. Room service are Soo much of time consuming. Network issues. WiFi not working properly
ID-1643	Very feasible location for stay near German consulate Chennai, quiet comfortable with the room. Don't find any good food restaurants nearby for food. Value for money booked via MMT. Breakfast included is okay, not too good.
ID-1644	The area where the hotel is located is best one, it is the exact place where Google show you unlike misleading to other locations. I arrived at night, the staff were good but the room where like smelly and not clean. The wardrobe was full of matchbox and the room smelled like cigarette. The reconditioning system didn't work as I thought. Overall experience was average.
ID-1645	Very good location in are R A Puram, Chennai. Deluxe room was clean and spacious. Complimentary breakfast was okay, lunch was good. Service from the hotel staff was average, receptionists should be more responsive to guests. Overall, good hotel at a decent price.
ID-1646	Nice staff. But the rooms were not cleaned daily. The TV did not work properly. The common areas were not clean. This hotel covered the basics. It is good value for the money.
ID-1647	I have been staying here for quite some time having made four visits in the last 2 months. The facilities are absolutely great considering the price. All in all, a very satisfying experience and would strongly recommend the same to freinds
ID-1648	The hotel room is clean, tidy. This place is centrally located. This place has good service and would suggest to one and all for a stay out here. Good, clean and cozy
ID-1649	Best place to stay at a very decent price.. Room was very clean and had all the needed facilities. But some renovation work was happening which made our stay a bit unpleasant. Have to force them to stop it.
ID-1650	The hotel was decent, in a very good location. The day we arrived there was loud drilling noise as there was some renovation happening. We were not aware of this. We complained and then an hour later, action was taken. Not spectacular, but definitely an option worth considering for a short stay (especially if available on offer).
ID-1651	I don't refer anybody No cleaning no food reception girls very worst behaviour
ID-1652	Overall experience is good. Nice rooms. Some disturbances due to work in progress but it's temporary. Peaceful Residential area. Value for money. Nice connectivity of roads. Refill in room is not regular,,, like water, tea/coffee, etc. If you ask they will do it. Overall experience is very good nice breakfast too. You should try this. Very good experiance.
ID-1653	A good hotel, provides value for the money paid. The rooms were clean and nice. Simple and nice breakfast. The only problem I had was in the bathroom. The wash basin was leaking and water was flowing in the floor while using the basin.
ID-1654	The receptionist was badly drugged. Another man was lying on the sofa with his hand in his pants. The property is dingy. One if the worst mistake of my life to book with Treebo. Request everyone not to stay with any treebo property.
ID-1655	Newly done rooms, clean wall and floors. Bed sheets were not changed after previous guest checked out. They could have cleaned it at least. Bathroom also was not cleaned properly. Breakfast was good. I will go again as it is close to office, and value for.the money paid.
ID-1656	Very clean, very well maintained, service and hospitality were good. The complimentary breakfast included was also very good to meet requirements of all kinds. It is also located at prime area, convenient to travel around and it was a pleasant stay.
ID-1657	Comfort and cozy room. However, did not like the AC setup with the air blowing at just one direction of bed. Guess it's a design flaw. Size of room is good for one person.
ID-1658	Room was good but staff are ok ok. Service was poor. They did not even provide water.
ID-1659	Stayed here during my 2day official trip in Chennai. Rooms are a bit small but, extremely neat and clean having all the basic amenities. Located at a prime location with key places like Adyar and Santhome nearby. Breakfast is good with sufficient options though mostly South Indian. Best part is its basement pub, which attracts a lot of local crowd and plays some good music for one to chill out. Overall a nice place to stay at a decent price
ID-1660	It was totally a good experience to stay in your hotel. And memorable moments also there. All the services are somewhat better and nice. There is also available facilities like TV, AC. So totally it was a good nice and marvellous amazing and awesome. So the things are going to be like that only. Hence it was a better experience to narrate that.
ID-1661	The hotel is very nice, grand and service impeccable. My room was up on one of the higher floors, but unfortunately the view was not that great (facing courtyard and opposite side of the building). The room itself was clean, nicely furnished and comfortable. Loved to have such a place to stay!
ID-1662	It's amazing and I got so many benefits from this. They handle us very smooth. And the hotel appearance is very good and the members are like good participants. Their method of serving is very different from all of the Indian hotels. I think they are give complete approach to us.
ID-1663	Very comfortable stay. Staff vert helpful and food superb
ID-1664	Visited Chennai for one night and had a great experience at My Fortune. Great customer service, good food and luxurious living accommodation. Overall, amazing experience!
ID-1665	A great experience from check in to check out. Very good food and wonderful service.
ID-1666	"Hotel is good. But they do not have free airport pickup and charge very high amount for airport pickup / drop.
Wi-fi charge is abnormally high.
They do not accept payment by e-wallet. Only by cash or credit card.Due to this, making payment was somewhat inconvenient."
ID-1667	It was amazing & smooth
ID-1668	Excellent for value of money. Staff of the hotel was prompt on their service either I order in mid night then also they provided the thing I don't like in the hotel was I asked the ice bucket in night and the reply was that we have no ice.
ID-1669	Except free WiFi the hotel hosts nice rooms tidy and cozy. The staff is very polite. Breakfast was delicious with good variety and prompt service. Stay was pleasant and will highly recommend it for a personal or family stay.
ID-1670	Very close to where I needed to be, so it's the best location for me. Service at breakfast was outstanding. Room service isn't super prompt. In general, the staff are exceptional. The key card has challenges working - maybe gets demagnetised easily. Did not get a chance to use any of the facilities at the hotel this time.
ID-1671	Stayed in the hotel for 2 days... It is a decent property with very humble and courteous staff. Food was nice.. The room was nice and clean with all modern amenities. The location of the Hotel is very nice and easily approachable.
ID-1672	It is an old hotel but has been sufficiently renovated. It is very well-located and has service is outstanding. The staff is very well trained. The buffet breakfast is quite elaborate and very good. Of one has time, it is good to enjoy it leisurely before starting for the day. Did not try the other restaurants but am sure the service should be good.
ID-1673	The hotel which is the ertswhile Chola Sheraton is centrally located and worked well for me. What I like is the fact that the rooms are large (specially the Executive Club room). The hotel could improve its service though!!!
ID-1674	Rooms are very clean and very spacious. The building is old but maintained well. Overall it was a nice experience. Manager was very courteous. Food was good. Facilities provided to the accompanying drivers was not satisfactory.
ID-1675	Little improvement on Food and food house
ID-1676	. Didi right
ID-1677	Over all excellent and pricing too. It's in the Heart of the city. Well connectivity to all leading areas, malls, theatres, Hospital, and everything. Surrounded by Posh residential colonies like Poes Gardens. Marina Beach is just a walkable distance from the hotel.
ID-1678	Lovely place, lovely staff... Lovely stay. The food was good, expensive though. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was extremely comfortable and clean. Service for towels, cleaning etc extremely efficient.
ID-1679	Conversation was not that much
ID-1680	.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
ID-1681	My stay at the hotel was good as far as location is concerned. What I feel was that there should be reorganization needed at the reception area. There should be good ample seating facility available for the just arrived customers. Pool side, though small area, may be opened for customer which wasn't at my stay. It must not be kept for show piece rather it should be allowed for users i.e guests. Beside this, the service and food were very good.
ID-1682	I know this hotel 33 years when I landed in Chennai in 1982. Formerly known as Chola Sheraton. Repeated stay. Quick check-in process and awarded upgraded room. Excellent service. Room was very comfortable and had pleasant stay. Good breakfast spread and tasty. Value you for money.
ID-1683	It was great, the stay was perfect. Perfect rooms but they charge you for wifi. Even the variety of breakfast was something you would end up talking about all day long
ID-1684	Excellent stay! Staff were great and meals were fantastic
ID-1685	"We had visited chennai for a social get together. Stayed at My fortune cathedral Rd
The room was spacious and clean. It was a pleasant stay and the staff were very helpful."
ID-1686	The hotel and staff were excellent, they tried to accomodate our every need. The bathroom however, needed to be cleaned properly.
ID-1687	"It was a pleasant stay, staff was friendly, food was excellent , facilities were in line with my expectations but no free internet! restaurant is good and the foods are very good.

below expectation - pillow cases do not smell fresh, shower need to function properly .

Location is OK but traffic & transportation are very bad."
ID-1688	Staff, food, room everything excellant enjoyed the area
ID-1689	Very convenient location, in middle of city and easy approach to every office
ID-1690	GREAT STAY , EVERYTHING WAS UP TO MARK WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY
ID-1691	good food, somewhere to crash and good customer service
ID-1692	The staff was really helpful. Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a big storm -- so the phones lines were down. But otherwise, the staff was incredibly helpful and the stay was very comfortable.
ID-1693	This is a pure business hotel for those visiting any of the companies located nearby. Good rooms, good gym facilities including a nice pool, excellent roomservice food which is important since there is __nothing__ in the neighbourhood.
ID-1694	Hotel is rather new so everything was in tip top condition. What is outstanding though is the service. Hotel staff (be in at the front desk or at the restaurants) are attentive and observant down to the details. Even though I had checked out in the morning, I was offered a room to shower and freshen up when I returned in the evening to collect my luggages, so that I could take my flight back in comfort.

ID-1721	Maintenance of shower etc not up to the mark. Room with broken hand shower given without rectifying the same. (Room No 327 on 16/07/2016) which was discovered in the morning. Otherwise ok. Well maintained restaurant though service is slow. Needs to improve.

ID-1726	very good hotel and wud like to come back to stay
ID-1727	excellent...
ID-1728	The worst hotel ever. The hotel rooms are worth only for 1000 bucks..the food was the worst part of all.. the morning breakfast...the most terrible thing I ever ate in my life. I will never book that hotel again. Not at all worth for money.
ID-1729	"Hotel is decently priced and is not far away from ammenities.

Quiet and hotel with a good energy.

Easy to get an auto.

V. Das"
ID-1730	It was good ,nice and clean
ID-1731	.Average neatness .Required towels etc were not readily available .
ID-1732	"The room were nice and clean on arrival, but the A/C was not cooling, TV was not working, WIFI was a struggle to get connected to. Once these problems were resovled, the stay was relatively pleasant.
Food choices are less. Need to expand more.
Also, parking space needs to be expanded. Highly unorganized parking cost me one whole evening plan as I had some other untracked guest's car parked in front of mine."
ID-1733	Location is ok but hard to find, room was average but I think that you wouldn't expect anything better at this price.
ID-1734	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 25-27 Jan 2017. It was an awful experience. Rooms were dingy, no fresh air experience. Beds were not good, safe lockers not working, no coffee tea maker as advertised, no good bathroom accessories like shower gels, not even foot mats... Breakfast was so horrible that we skipped it the second day. Not at all a 3 * hotel.. Over all a really bad experience
ID-1735	Very good worth staying service good...............
ID-1736	Satisfied
ID-1737	The hotel is located in a quite & secluded lane in a nice neighborhood. Good value for money.
ID-1738	Good hotel, booked it through Oyo rooms & had requested for an early check-in but the folks did not get that request and ended up paying extra, apart from that the hotel was quite good, decent rooms and very good locality. Quite perfect for folks coming to Chennai for their US visas as it's quite close to the processing centre & embassy(About 2kms). All in all a good stay and neat rooms with decent food options nearby!
ID-1739	I was on a business trip to Chennai and was for the first time visit I found my stay very comfortable and overall experience was awesome! Staff was timely handling the service and housekeeping was good. Meal was awesome and it was hot and tasty!! I recommend to make your stay best and comfortable. Also the pool was big enough. If you are not caring for cost you get the best services.
ID-1740	I stayed in this hotel, it is very good hotel. Location is so nice and beautiful. Food quality is so nice and tasty. I never miss my home because it give me food like my home. We all are very happy to live in this hotel and fully enjoyed. I always want to live here.
ID-1741	We stayed here with family in December during my sister's wedding and was very happy with everything. Room is spacious and good. Staff are courteous with smiling faces. Room service and housekeeping both are so quick with in no time they are attending with ordered items. Necessary toiletries are provided. Very good homely food quantity and quality wise. Stupendous services. I am definitely going to come back to this place.
ID-1742	When I visited Chennai I stayed in bluten hotel , chennai with my family. The destination was good.the food was tasty and drinks provided by the hotel was good.the room was fully air conditioned . the location of this hotel was good. The appearance of this hotel was average. The service provided by the hotel staff was good. The hotel staff was friendly. I have requested to my friends to visit this hotel if they visited chennai

ID-1747	Good hotel. Went with my family. Room was very good with good view, was very neat and clean. The bathroom and Air Conditioning needs attention. Food was very good both in room service which was quick and also in restaurant.
ID-1748	Our room was located directly above the outside restaurant which played loud music late into the night keeping us awake. The music was so loud that our room was shaking. Everything else was fine but the reason you get a hotel is to rest, and the excessively loud music made it impossible to sleep.
ID-1749	Bathroom was sticking drainage smell asked for spegetii with olive which was not served after complain got it exchanged but not upto the mark n upon check in surprise was spoiled as reception said cnt allow localites Ms Anita never reverted back on my questions one day before check in I asked her thanks to manger of Fo who atleat allowed us to stay m not localite but ramada is knwn peoperty in India should not create such a kind of regulations
ID-1750	excellent room.... hot  water not hot enough... a little difficult   for  Uber  drivers
ID-1751	Staff is slow but polite and cooperative. Evening dinner not good choices. Nearby restaurants not easily reachable. Talke local teansportation after one block, when they see you walking out of Hotel your charges will double. Do bargain for local transportation, give them 60-75% of what they ask. Over all good experiance. I do recommend hotel if you dont spend too much time in room.
ID-1752	"Overall, great experience
Staff were always friendly and helpful
The hotel was located near to most places and not too far to International Airport
Restaurants were great.Breakfast was fantastic."
ID-1753	Good hotel
ID-1754	Reception area is relatively huge and impressive but the bathroom faucets were loose and hanging. Every time we have to fix it after use.
ID-1755	"A well located hotel, with decent sized rooms (bit dated decor) and good sized bathrooms and reasonable amenities.

The dinner buffet is well priced and food decent quality.

What sets this hotel out from the pack is the staff. Friendly, well trained and helpful."
ID-1756	Pleasant stay, great breakfast too.
ID-1757	Excellent stay.  Friendly, courteous, professional staff.  Outstanding breakfast!  This will be my place of choice on my next trip to Chennai.
ID-1758	The room was comfortable & location of Hotel is excellent. However the service is pathetic and annoying...staff needs a lot of training of understsnding & helping guests.
ID-1759	Location so so . Traffic was bad.  Second time stay in this hotel and food is always the same at breakfast table. Sad thing is no room slipper provided . I was given a room near the life which is noisy at night .
ID-1760	Great hotel at a perfect location. Comfortable stay for a day.. will stay again at this place .
ID-1761	The best of the best.... excellent service.... top notch... .
ID-1762	Hotel staff are terrible and their policies. Everything you need to pay over priced. May be the owner trying to recover his renovation cost fast from guests.  Pls read carefully before booking/checking this hotel. They will empty your wallet.
ID-1763	Recently renovated and clean room. Spacious and comfortable beds. Fantastic bathrooms. Overall we had an amazing stay.
ID-1764	The hotel rooms are very clean and hygienic.The breakfast buffet is really good.
ID-1765	Stay was very comfortable. Staff were friendly and service was professional
ID-1766	friendly staff
ID-1767	The location is very central and the property has been maintained well. I am returning after almost 10 yrs and glad to note this. I had to score a point less, as the breakfast wasn't the freshest best. The inroom service (dinner) was very tasty but rip-off expensive.
ID-1768	This is good hotel for business traveler. Hotel is clean. Location is good. Food is good and tasty. The only thing which I did not liked was service which could be exception. They were taking much more time to do any room service. Morning breakfast was awesome. They provide almost every modern facility you expect in a good hotel. Also I feel they should increase their manpower.
ID-1769	I stayed for two days and was extremely happy with the location, service, food and ambience of the hotel. The location is very convenient for business as well as shopping. You will also find lot of eateries around the hotel.
ID-1770	Very good hotel in Chennai. I never ever seen this type hotel. I was welcomed by everyone with a great smile and I have enjoyed a lot with their hospitality extended during my stay in the hotel. I suggest every one to stay in this hotel at-least one day to get more and more excitement.
ID-1771	Good room size, cleaning was good but need of room fresheners. Good bed quality. Need more water bottle as complementary. Food price was bit high. Need comb & saving kit, need Mobile charger in rooms in case someone missed to bring. Bath soap is to provided as there were only one soap available in room.
ID-1772	Its really value for money. Ambience is good. Food quality is good. Location is in central of Chennai and market area. Its very pleasant stay for us. Lifts are very speedy and superb. Its overall get hotel and value for money. They provided unlimited water bottles and WiFi spew is excellent.. Neat and very clean room as usual.
ID-1773	Its really value for money. Ambience is good. Food quality is good. Location is in central of Chennai and market area. Its very pleasant stay for us. Lifts are very speedy and superb. Its overall get hotel and value for money.
ID-1774	Hotel staff were very friendly during the entire stay.
ID-1775	GRT Grand has good location with excellent buffets. If you are lucky you would come across few south actors and actresses as there are frequent parties going on. Would love to stay again. Centrally located within the city.
ID-1776	I was quite fascinated by the decor, proximity of the hotel to nearby markets and places to visit. The breakfast buffet was quite elaborate as well. Overall, it was an amazing stay in the heart of the city. Really enjoyed!!
ID-1777	It was an amazing place with very courteous staff. Would have appreciated with a hot water kettle with some tea bags and other accessories in the room. Otherwise the place is really good. I liked the French toast in the breakfast a lot. Go for it!
ID-1778	Right from the word GO, great lives up to the highest standards of hospitality. At the cost, it is a steal. Rooms are spacious with good warm guest relation executives. The gymnasium, breakfast spread, the ambience is all worth the spend. Would love to come back and stay!
ID-1779	We were very impressed with the hotel. The excellent food was only surpassed by great service! Very chic and modern. Will definitely come back. All the staff from the greeters to the wait staff were courteous, helpful and willing to put 110% effort.
ID-1780	The hotel was located outside of the city. I had visited this hotel for official purpose with my colleagues. The quality of the food was good. The activities were not conducted by the hotel. The construction was going on when I reach the hotel. The varieties of food were provided by the hotel. The overall experience of this hotel was good.
ID-1781	A perfect experience! Clean rooms, professional and attentive staff, beautiful roof top pool area, nice buffet. Would rate this hotel at the top of the mid-range hotel and would most definitely stay there again.
ID-1782	Worth the money
ID-1783	Very nice hotel in IT section of Chennai. The one disappointment was mosquitoes in the lobby seating area. I sat in the lobby area talking with an associate one evening and got bitten multiple times, which I didn't expect in a hotel of this quality.
ID-1784	Though it was only an overnight stay -- overall I had a very good experience.  The staff is courteous & attentive, and the rooms are nice, new, &comfortable.   The breakfast also had a decent spread.  Only small area of improvement that I noticed was the level of lighting in the hotel lobby -- it was fairly dark both during the evening as well as morning time.  Hotel lobby lighting is usually much brighter!
ID-1785	Excellent hotel, friendly stuff. Warmly recommended. Do not expect, though, that they would have a city map or organized guided tours.
ID-1786	amazing I loved it
ID-1787	Hotel is really great. Staff should be trained properly so that lesser inconvenience to guests. May be their processes should be fine tuned for convenience of guests
ID-1788	Great helpful staff, good breakfast buffet, comfortable rooms, good view of OMR,
ID-1789	Definitely value for money, breakfast is too good and room service and room facilities are awesome especially the pool which is located on the 10th floor of the building and during evening you can see the sunset and have a wonderful feeling, totally I had a great experience.
ID-1790	I am basically travelling all over india and come to Chennai regularly, usually I stay in Lemon Tree and to be honest, Lemon Tree is not worth that money, so I tried this new hotel which is near my friend's flat, it is quite Clean, fruits are good quality, service is fast and nice. Hotel is full of modern, fashion and comfortable.
ID-1791	Extremely well kept place with courteous staff, great rooms and good spread for breakfast. Arrived late in the night but was welcomed by the night staff and was checked in with no hassle. They also have a good spa and gym facility. The towels and sheets are clean and well kept.
ID-1792	We were told to check out maximum you 12 pm and the reason given was room is full booked. Their check in timing is 2 pm. We asked for a smoking rooms but was not provided. No liquor license. Good not great.
ID-1793	Overall okay, good instructor in the gym. Front office staff was pleasant.(Anu). Very convenient location for work. Well maintained in terms of property. Scope of improvement in Night shift - Duty Manager.
ID-1794	The hotel I tried for the first time as it was a short stay. The place looks very cosy. The staff at reception were very friendly and very helpful. The hotel is very clean and the room was quite cosy and the service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel. Worth for the money you pay.
ID-1795	Overall not value for money... Considering the facilities offered. Breakfast and dinner buffet spread needs improvement.. No Bar is a drawback for people who want to enjoy some drinks... Can do better. Friendly staff. New construction on the OMR.. Fair distance from Airport.
ID-1796	Pros: Prime location, Fantastic interiors, Friendly staff and quick service. Cons: Needs more facilities (only one restaurant was open, rooftop dine and bar was shut down). P. S : I wanted to check-out a little late. The management was kind enough to let me check out by 3. 30pm (regular check-out time is 12pm).
ID-1797	Very nice ambience and fantastic rooms.. 1 day WiFi is free and also the entrance of the hotel with a piano is mind blowing.. House keeping is good and the staff are very good and also good response for anything.. It's like my home in Chennai loved it.
ID-1798	The short word to say this hotel is SS (Simply Superb). I think there are totally 9 floors in the hotel, we stayed at the 8th floor. The dedication of the staff makes me high to stay in this hotel. The variety of foods are so good.
ID-1799	I went to Chennai for business purposes and stayed there for 2 days. The Hotel is very close to the IT Hub and road side. The ambiance is fantastic and the staff were so friendly for any kind of assistance. Very delicious breakfast and you will get all traditional food. It was too amazing and I recommend.
ID-1800	I felt okay at the hotel. May be I had a bad day. AC water was leaking and room floor was having lot of water. It wasted my one hour in the morning and breakfast got delayed. Staff arranged bread omelette for me though.
ID-1801	Worst hotel I've ever stayed. Was frustrated with the hotel. Those people found hard to give some drinking water. And moreover the way the front office people did put me in a sick position. Please my advice is not to stay there.
ID-1802	If you need to stay in the OMR area, I would recommend this hotel. Please keep in mind they haven't got their liquor permission yet but they have already advertised for it. The omelette in the breakfast is one of the best I have eaten! The hotel staff is very polite and willing to go the extra mile. They have teething problems as its a new hotel. I hope that they will iron out the little problems with the F&B.
ID-1803	First stayed at the newly opened Turyaa Chennai. Very welcoming. Excellent hotel with an awesome staff. Everyone here strives to give a great service. Breakfast buffet was delicious. Would stay here again. Hopefully the same standards are maintained.
ID-1804	Nice variety of options in the breakfast buffet. Good gym and pool. Clean and comfortable rooms.
ID-1805	My stay coincided with 2 unfortunate incidences: currency exchange problem with rupees and cyclone vardah. The hotel could have capitalized on the currency exchange problem to provide some currency exchange for guests. I would then have some rupees to tip service staff. But hotel did not stand out from other hotels on this front.
ID-1806	It so happened that the day of our departure from Chennai cyclone erupted. The airport was closed, there was neither Internet nor telephone. The hotel staff was quite kind (and most importantly, competent enough that uncommon for India!) to help us with the status of our tickets, which allowed us to fly from congested airport after the disaster had finished.
ID-1807	Very friendly staff, room was very spacious and nicely organized.  Perhaps the best organized bathroom facilities that I seen in the last little while.
ID-1808	The staff went out of the way to serve us well and were attentive to our needs
ID-1809	This hotel is centrally located to the biggest mall in Chennai as well as a short drive to Chennai Internatioinal airport. The staff are all very polite and no request is too large (they even helped me dress in a Saree for a traditional day at our Chennai offices!)
ID-1810	"Really lovely hotel with pleasant staff. 
Very cool and airy rooms
Great bar with big screen to watch the sports"
ID-1811	The hotel overall is nice. The reception staff was not welcoming towards us. However all the other staff at the front and hotel overall were friendly.
ID-1812	My stay in Westin was a great experience. Staffs were very professional and neat. Food was great apart from too much oil in some indian dishes. Loved my massages. Maybe the spa could reduce the volume of the music as some Chinese music can be loud. Overall I really enjoyed my stay. Kudos to all the staffs who attended to my calls. Wonderful experience. Thanks for making my stay a memorable one.
ID-1813	I am a very seasoned traveller. Bedrooms are getting tired and frayed. I stayed here for 3 days. I ate NOWHERE else and even then took great care selecting food from buffet avoiding uncooked. I still got sick. Could only be from the buffet in the ground floor restaurant, they had closed the Thai restaurant I have used previously. I won't be going back.
ID-1814	Room was damp and had a strong humidity smell. The bed felt moist with dampness made the entire night very uncomfortable. It is important for hotels to have proper dehumidification process given Chennai's weather. On the positive note, the service at the restaurant was quite good.
ID-1815	Budget hotel closer to Appasamy hospital. On busy road, you will hear sound till 10:00 pm after that it's quiet. Near by restaurants are there .
ID-1816	Was great! Staff friendly & helpful with good English. Also a lovely spa just upstairs
ID-1817	The property is hygenic. The facilities listed are well provided and taken care of. The management is very good in taking care of. M totally satisfied about the property
ID-1818	No hot water.wifi limited to lobby. Average cleanliness.
ID-1819	Neat room with clean washroom. Really very good experience I never had anywhere. The hotel was very good for the money paid, Exactly what I need from a hotel. In the future I will recommend your apartment to other people. Thanks for this service to OYO. Please carry on this service.
ID-1820	"Very happy stay.
Simple and clean hotel.
Would recommend to friends at this price."
ID-1821	A decent budget hotel
ID-1822	This is my second time through oyo and they doing great off course as they have lessened the hotel tariffs almost into half when compared to 2014. The hotel was compact, affordable, modern, courteous staff and calm and peaceful. I am trusting oyo once for all my business visits.
ID-1823	Chennai is a beautiful place to visit, in such a busy city found this peaceful hotel with all comforts, nice beautiful rooms, well-furnished and even well-maintained by the house keeping staff, the hotel staff were also very humble. Nice and big TV with d2h connection, well-maintained wash rooms. There is nice restaurant near by where nice South Indian food is served. So overall had a great experience.
ID-1824	Hotel was neat and clean. Staff were very courteous. Gym was the flip side, lacks very basic equipments. Breakfast buffet was good. Live kitchen was awesome. Located near IT expressway, so no commuting problem.
ID-1825	Hotel is located at the Chennai sipcot entrance, hotel is very calm and located for easy access and very good response from the reception and also, the food provided is very good and if you are a looking for a hotel at sipcot then it's a good choice.
ID-1826	The hotel is extremely inflexible and policies don't exhibit the trend expected from multi national chain.. And the staff exhibit a behaviour of that of a one bound by a line showing little or no ingenuity while making decisions for customer requests.. Not impressed..
ID-1827	Good service and good breakfast. Overall, a pleasant stay. Hotel staff were very friendly. Restaurant food was very good. Rooms were clean and tidy. Location is next to Sipcot so it is very convenient. Worth the money.
ID-1828	Everything regarding hotel is fine except room is small, location is good and service is excellent. Hotel staff behaviour is fine, nice for short stay especially for business purpose, book your stay at this hotel and you won't be disappointed.
ID-1829	No worth the money, a basic hotel with 150 square feet room, you cannot even turn in the bathroom. Towels were not clean and they charge extra for even room delivery of items. If you have to invite anybody for a talk there is hardly any place to sit.
ID-1830	No breakfast and no dental kit provided. Waste of money. They really charge high. No shaving kit, no complimentary water bottles provided. Such a worst experience. I don't recommend this hotel to others.
ID-1831	I had booked this room by online. There was no delay in check in and checkout in this hotel. The behaviour of the staffâ€™s was friendly. The service was done on time. The room was spacious and clean. All amenities were provided in working condition in the room. The food quality was not good. The bar facility was not available at the hotel. The activity was provided at the hotel. I had visited this hotel for marriage purpose.
ID-1832	I was there for a business trip, hence the location was very close to my office. Its good business budget hotel. The rooms are very good however the washrooms are really small ( i mean really small). Food was okay .. not great veg north Indians. Hospitality is warm and the staff is really good. It has a gym and bar. Stay overall is good. Best for short stay.
ID-1833	We have been travelling across India for business purpose staying in various hotels. But I must say staying in this hotel was the worst of all. Small rooms, no extra facilities. Charging for each and everything without any limit. Will never suggest anyone to opt for this hotel. A sheer pain in the wallet experience.
ID-1834	Location is very good just 1 km from TCS Office. Food and drink are costly and quality wise it's average. Housekeeping was good. Front desk was very active and prompt. Airport transfer facility is good. Buffet dinner is very costly compared to other 3 star hotels. It would be good if this hotel is having a SPA.
ID-1835	Booked the room for myself and my best friend for a relaxing break. The place is simply amazing! One of the best places I have stayed in so far. You can go for this without a second thought. The awesome and cozy room makes you feel like you never want to leave the place!
ID-1836	Except bathroom size which is standard for IBIS Hotel around the world. All facility is good, had a breakfast in this hotel, it was okay. This hotel is cost effective and economically feasible under 3K INR. Very good option, mostly used by people or relative working in SIPCOT IT Park as there is no sightseeing nearby. It is good for corporate people.
ID-1837	I liked the hotel for its pool and ambiance and also the service provided by them. It has a good system of technology with good persons and the food is extremely good with good service. Rooms are very well cleaned by the staff regularly finally a good hotel to stay.
ID-1838	The room was extremely cramped up. The bathroom is like that in a tight yacht with a major space crunch. They don't even provide you with the basic toiletry. Staff is courteous. Room service does not have many options and they charge a premium for in room delivery.
ID-1839	slow front desk with big attitude problem
ID-1840	Good
ID-1841	Pride located in centre of city.It is close to many theatres ,restaurants and malls.Eventhough its an old hotel interior of room and reception are maintained very well.Food quality at restaurant is good.As awhile its a good budget hotel
ID-1842	Hotel location is heart of the city. Hotel staff are good and cooperative. We are fully enjoyed at their place.. Food is also good. If they add some toiletry kit than much better. Price are very reasonable. Cleanliness was everywhere. We refer to our friend circle.
ID-1843	Rusted bathrooms, quality not maintained like before. Hair on the bathroom floor and toilet seats. Not worth the money. Only good thing is they allowed late check out since I checked in late at night. Location is great.
ID-1844	I stayed at Pride hotel Chennai on 11 & 12 July 2016. Booking was done through makemytrip. Com. Hotel is good. Room was very clean and comfortable. Reception response could have been better. Roof top restaurant was OK. Morning breakfast at Cafe Treat was really good. Overall comfortable stay.
ID-1845	Good locality, rooms were good but food was pathetic. Seen mosquitoes, flies and some other small insects were taking breakfast along with us. Seen cockroach in the dining. Otherwise it was a nice stay. If you plan to stay, better plan to have your food outside.
ID-1846	It was really a good hotel to stay with family and its valuable property for money. Except the massage service all others are fine. Bar at the first floor looks good, price slightly on the higher side. Pool was little small. Otherwise there is no much disadvantages there.
ID-1847	It was a good experience staying in The Pride hotel, Chennai. Breakfast was very nice and staff was helpful. I wish the massage center is kept open till 10. 00 pm for those arriving late in the hotel after hectic day. Lift size was too small and could take just 2-3 guest comfortably, without luggage.
ID-1848	The Pride is a good business class hotel in Chennai just 3km from Chennai central station. The reception and overall staff is very warm and check in process is very fast. Food is excellent and complimentary breakfast has lots of variety. A good business hotel in Chennai.
ID-1849	An OK experience....room service was expensive ...breakfast can be laid out better...
ID-1850	Clean and safe. WiFi was somehow not working the entire 3 days I was there. Overall. I'd recommend it to others as well. Location is good as it is on the main road itself and it is easy to move around from here.
ID-1851	Pride The
ID-1852	Rooms are stinky as well as corridor. As soon you enter the elevator that pungent smell remains till you come out of hotel. The wooden furniture & carpet are too old and probably need to be replaced. Location wise it is good and service wise response is slow. Behaviour of staff is good.
ID-1853	Bathroom is very small in the deluxe room which does not hold good for the price paid. Even plug points & extra bed are all obsolete and not user friendly. Staff are OK. Over all higher price by 20% for the amenities provided. Food is OK not great. Needs improvement
ID-1854	It was a good stay and the rooms are good. Breakfast is good and centrally located for easy mobility. Room keys are not working, may be time to replace the system. Other facilities like gym and pool are under maintenance as per the management. On the whole it was a fine short business stay.
ID-1855	It was good and nice stay, I enjoyed. It's centrally located, easy to go to other places. Room is good and the service guys are really helpful. I had a very good stay there. Breakfast spread is really good.
ID-1856	For official visit it is perfect for location but number of facilities are not available like pool and gym remains under maintenance. Rooms are good. Hospitality is also good. Ambiance is not at par with other Pride Group hotels but can be comparable.
ID-1857	I had a bad time because the wifi was not working. I needed to some important an urgent work. Repeated complaints to the reception staff got me nothing but false reassurance! The management need to really pull up their socks and hire some decent staff or at least educate their staff regarding how to help customers. Also false promises like free wifi should not be made.
ID-1858	rooms are very small , bathroom even more worst
ID-1859	Hospitality is maintained very well, rooms r spacious, washroom are bit conjusted, breakfast was good, buffet at puran dhaba very tasty. Staff always to help.
ID-1860	"Excellent hotel in chennai. And the staff are really good and they were able to allow an early check-in and late check-out. everything was excellent except for the bar which was horrible and not well stocked, bar tender had no knowledge bout drinks. But the others things made up for it.
This is an awesome hotel"
ID-1861	Nice stay at pride as it was convenient to travel to US consulate for two days and i have got my US visa on time. I really appreciate because they helped me in early check in at 7.00 am and upgraded me to a better luxury room as i had some issue with toilet. But they all extended their support and had good experience.
ID-1862	Took an hour to find this hotel. It is away from the main street, but loved the view from our room. We arrived around 10pm after almost 8 hours of drive from Chennai. All we wanted was a good, hot shower but to our dismay the hot shower was not working. They took 2 hours to get that repaired. The staff were trying their best, but its just that we were so frustrated!
ID-1863	"Nothing fantastic about this hotel. Only thing I could think of was the staff at the restaurant. He speaks well and excellent customer service.

Bathroom was small, towels were dirty, toilet bowls were dirty too!

Far from airport."
ID-1864	The air conditioning spits water and the room feels very moist and smells weirdly. The reception staff are not flexible or understanding so, please be very eloquent during your enquiry. The food is expensive and very basic. Internet is charged.
ID-1865	decent business hotel but pool not great. dinner on the terrace is nice with great service. service overall was quite good. wish the pool was better and bigger and cleaner. staff is helpful.
ID-1866	The man at reception in the morning was most helpful .
ID-1867	We liked the place.  Rest room was good, but  would like to have availability of tissues and toilet paper also.
ID-1868	We were generally happy with our stay in this hotel.
ID-1869	Mahalaya Residency is a good option to choose transit passages. Itâ€™s very near to the airport plus there's complimentary pickup and drop for the guests that was great. Front office staff are very friendly and as express check in and checkout policy.
ID-1870	Location is dead on. Very near to airport. Airport drop was perfect. Even at 3 in the morning they dropped me at airport. No cribbing or confusion. Coming to cleanliness they can improve. Towels dod not appeal. Bed sheet okay only. But overall, 100% OK for transit stay.
ID-1871	Nice location for transit passengers. Efficient pickup and drop service to the airport. Do not expect too much from the room but has excellent value for money. Complimentary breakfast. Washrooms could be improved. Stayed twice and will stay again in the future.
ID-1872	Staff are very professional and helpful. Rooms are neat and clean. Morning breakfast are very tasty. Very near to airport. We have been to temples in kundrathur, Avadi. Value for the money. We had a very good time.
ID-1873	Other than proximity to the airport and the room service, there's nothing to say about this place. Last time we stayed at savera in Chennai which was really good and this one leaves bad memory. A word about room service personnel which is a Plus for them even though the food quality was average.
ID-1874	Perfect stay near airport.. Well occupancy, well clean, neat and perfect stay to go ahead.. With affordable cost and good cleanliness too. Give a try and my experience was most better and satisfied with this.
ID-1875	"The hotel location is very close to the airport. The rooms are clean, but little noisy. 
Food is not pricy."
ID-1876	Very good in all front, near to airport and they have pick-up drop facility without any charge. Staff are very good and cooperative. Restaurant /Bar is also very good.. Can be suitable for 1-2 day's. Connectivity to Airport and city is very good.
ID-1877	Hotel is very near to airport. Breakfast was not so good. Food was excellent, Bar is very good but I preferred to chill at room as BAR was very crowded after 7pm. Airport pickup and drop was good even I needed it at 3 am
ID-1878	I always use the Mahalaya when coming back from a trip in the middle of the night. The hotel driver picks you up from the airport in 5 minutes, the rooms are clean and service is great. It is the best airport hotel in Chennai for a reasonable rate. Good value. But you must request a good room: some are much better than others.
ID-1879	The hotel is overpriced. The rooms are not clean and the food quality is bad. Stay here only if closeness to Airport is very important to you. Prices are too high for the level of comfort offered. If possible travel to either Guindy or beyond Tambaram for much better rooms.
ID-1880	It was a fantastic stay in the hotel. The staff was good and cooperative. The rooms were clean and maintained. The food in the restaurant was good and fresh and nicely served. Moreover it was a good experience.
ID-1881	The room was small, although clean. Friendly staff, who were quite helpful. The restaurant food was reasonable. The toilet accessories were minimal. However, the location is very good. The bed should have a different mattress and it was very uncomfortable.
ID-1882	Non cooperative staff and no service during breakfast, overall no value for money paid. Would not recommend to any friend, would request Makemytrip to not downgrade themselves by taking such hotels into their fold.
ID-1883	Hotel does not provide facilities as per three star standards. They have to Improve their quality of services to provide value for money being charged. One feels short changed. The same doesn't provide a comfortable stay which one is looking for.
ID-1884	It was a memorable stay. The staff was very cooperative. Cleanliness was really up to the mark. It is value for money. Services were also prompt and instant. Located very near to the airport, it is a good transit hotel.
ID-1885	 courtesy vehicle
ID-1886	just two minutes away from airport friendly staff came to pick us from airport 2am good timing
ID-1887	Stay was short -- only for one night -- but was very comfortable
ID-1888	Very Bas Hotel. Just nearby Airport. unkind & dirty, Noisy hotel.
ID-1889	Staff were helpful, it is close to the airport. The bathroom fixtures were old, holes in the doors, and could use some renovation and upkeep. It was okay since we just stayed there for a couple of hours before having to take a flight.
ID-1890	"Very nice hotel close to the airport. 
Good food in the hotel restaurant. 
Quick check in and out."
ID-1891	The hotel staff is friendly but the hotel room comfort is poor.
ID-1892	If you are going to Chennai just for shopping then the hotel is far from T. NAGAR .
ID-1893	I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It was an oasis of calm in a frenetic environment of clearing up after the cyclone, dealing with demonetisation and the excitement and crowds of the Chennai test match. Well done India ; a really talented team. The restaurant staff were helpful and friendly, Bappa especially, and the food very good.
ID-1894	Staff was very attentive, from front desk to the housekeeping to the restaurant. Staff was great!
ID-1895	Very calm and quite place to live in the busy city
ID-1896	the staff became more friendly after the first day.  became very willing and helpful.
ID-1897	This is a small neat little hotel with all facility. Excellent management more like the owner has a direct hand in running this property. Rooms, washroom, staff, breakfast bed, linen all five star this Is a excellent property well run.
ID-1898	Good hotel in a prime location close to the beach and US consulate. The rooms are neat and the toilets are clean and spacious. The complimentary breakfast they provide has a good spread. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a room in Chennai.
ID-1899	The location is so strategic that it is close to many places you plan to visit. The rooms are very clean and the service is excellent. The best VAS is a free drop to the US consulate. The Spencer's mall, heritage temples, Higginbotham are a must visit places.
ID-1900	Room is very extraordinary and very good service. Food is unbelievable and taste in my opinion. Bed and bathroom is very clean and hygienic. In one word my experience is excellent in this hotel.
ID-1901	"The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.
if you require a taxi, the hotel staff gets you one and help negotiate a good price.

we enjoyed our stay at the hotel."
ID-1902	Been here for my visa interview with family. Stay was cool and decent. Hotel staff was good. I requested for late check out and was arranged with one room while other one had to be checked out due to booking. The restaurant options were not many. We preferred breakfast hot but was cold. Plus point is it is close to US consulate and Chennai VAC.
ID-1903	Had a good stay at the La Woods. The restaurant options were not many, but the location had ample of options nearby. Was very happy with the room, and the stay, including the behaviour of the hotel staff. There are not a whole lot of amenities at the hotel, but if all you are looking for is a good place to rest for the night, while you complete your work during the day, this is a good choice.
ID-1904	Hotel is very good and facility also very good and all staff service but hospitality is little poor because no dental kit/no shaving kit. Rest all is good and location also good in hotel food variety is very less.
ID-1905	Excellent service from the staff. Very prompt and responsive. They helped with all queries immediately. Rooms are clean. The breakfast had variety and restaurant also provided good options. The location is ideal for any US consulate work, they even provide free drop. I would recommend to everyone.
ID-1906	Location good, staff very helpful hotel maintained neatly including lobby and other premises, breakfast is good, and other food average. Good for visa purpose stay and cab drop arranged to consulate.
ID-1907	The hotel is really good and worth your stay for the budget, location and food. It is located very close to Express Avenue mall and Spencer plaza and easy to connect to locality of Chennai. It's a stay that not to be missed.
ID-1908	Last week I visited, Chennai for my Visa interview, as I booked this Hotel via online portal - (Make my trip account) the login/logout schedule was quite strict (12 PM -12 PM) format, but thanks for the hotel staff who supported me to the max. Even though the hotel was full, which made my travel very comfortable.
ID-1909	Pretty nice and spacious room with modern fittings in bathroom. Hotel is centrally located in walking distance from Express Avenue mall though the street is a little dim lit in night. Breakfast buffet is good and staff is courteous and helpful. Overall definitely value for money hotel!
ID-1910	Very clean and king size bedroom at nominal price. Location is also good. Room service and food is good. WiFi facility free and speed is good. Express Avenue and Spencer Plaza (shopping mall) is nearby. Had a great stay.
ID-1911	Good and value for money. I stayed for one day on personal trip. And everything shopping to movie eating options everything is very close. Spencer's mall and express avenue are closer one. Breakfast need more options. Almost no north Indian dish is included.
ID-1912	I stayed here for a couple of nights, when I came for an US visa stamping. The room is very clean and service was good too. Location is good too, very near to US consulate. The complimentary breakfast buffet had many selection and was good too. Would definitely come back if need be.
ID-1913	Overall a good stay in La Woods, breakfast was excellent and included in the price.  The room was clean and well appointed, no windows in the room though so it can be disorienting.  FabIndia and other stores are within walking distance, and staff is helpful when you need directions or a recommendation for a place to go.
ID-1914	Room was not available after reaching there, so they made us to rest in backup room till the actual room is ready. Other than that evreything was fine.
ID-1915	Excellent staff, willing to go out of their way to make your stay great. Can't say enough about them. Good restaurant, clean room.
ID-1916	Not worth the rating shown. Service is not good. Room not well maintained. Room are spacious. Illumination of room was very poor. TV Remote not working. Carry good mosquito repalent. Location wise it is excellent who want to stay in near central Chennai.
ID-1917	The location is good as it lies between Central and Egmore. The service is very good. The food is Non Spicy but very tasty. Poor Wi-Fi connectivity. Good Ambience in lobby. However, More cleanliness is desired. In totality good value for budget travellers.
ID-1918	Lot of Mosquitoes in the AC room because of the proximity of the Kuvam river. Otherwise the room was clean and toilets were OK. Printing facilities were not good in the hotel when we wanted to take a print out of a business proposal. There is a 50/50 chance I might go there next time.
ID-1919	Hotel near by Chennai railway station. Good helping staff. Nice food. Very good AC for the room and all over the hotel. Very good complimentary breakfast with nice atmosphere. Stay is very good in hotel.
ID-1920	Very near to central and Egmore stations, it's value for money, it's worth for the amount, hotel was decent. A approachable to all near places, the food was OK, AC was working properly, Chennai always the climate would be humid kind off, but it was pleasant during my stay.
ID-1921	Good facilities. Excellent location. Worth for the payment. Really good restaurant and staff
ID-1922	Good location. Good facilities. Clean and well accessories in the bathroom with provision of towel, soap, shampoo, comb and oil. It's locate nearer to Chennai central having good restaurant with buffet system folding option.
ID-1923	It is value for money. Breakfast is good & staff are polite. Very good hotel for people coming & going by train. AC was good. Will definitely stay again if I come by train. Coffee served in room is very average & not hot & don't need so much quantity too.
ID-1924	The renovation work going on.. AC was Not good. No LED TVs provided. Hotels with this tariff level normally provide complimentary breakfast. But not here. Restaurant not good. Coffee served in the room was poor. If you are looking forward to move around Chennai city it is a convenient location.
ID-1925	Average thing in this hotel is average, but considering the price for the room, and the room is quite big. It is a hotel you can choose to stay. The location is some good seems it is close to the railway station. However, they have a very good part, their restaurant! The food is so delicious even compared to other expensive restaurant. But you should skip their buffet, and just go for their a-la-carte.
ID-1926	Room is not at all clean and sprayed with mosquito chemicals and smells bad. Also they are doing refurbishing the hotel and sounds are irritating and not able to take a sleep at all. Also many times I told them to stop or change the room after one hour stopped that sound by repeated calls only.
ID-1927	If you want to stay but you don't know location then go as per Makemytrip. Don't read instructions. Whatever you get is bonus for you. Not satisfied. Don't booked cab from hotel travel desk. They will charge Rs 1150/. Ola/ Uber charge only Rs 300/.
ID-1928	Hotel facilities is very good and sarvice is very good and location is very good and restaurants sarvice is very good and food is very good food like and testi and hotel sarvice is very good hotel facilities is very good so hotel is good
ID-1929	I had visited this hotel for official trip. I went this hotel by my own vehicle. The hotel was located in the city. The food was nice. The food was expensive. The non-vegetarian food was provided in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel. All the amenities were provided in the room. The room was neat and clean. The gym was arranged by the hotel.
ID-1930	Its a nice hotel near to Chennai central.. Awesome that's why I choosed this hotel, the staff are well behaved and helpful. Very near and walkable distance to Chennai central railway station and well decorated reception which gives attraction while entering with peace beauty and fragrance.
ID-1931	This hotel continues the fine tradition of Oyo Hotels using old photographs or one of a room that either does not exist or is made to look good just for the advertising. The foyer is like in the pictures but the other pictures?..
ID-1932	Everything was average right from the hotel condition to the the room and the bathroom.. The hotel is actually very very old and need renovation badly..
ID-1933	poor stay
ID-1934	We stayed at this hotel because we needed a place to stay for a 1 a.m. flight. It was clean and the staff got us a cab to the airport at a reasonable price. It was adequate for our needs.
ID-1935	Well room was not clean.. too was the bedsheets & bathroom. Disappointing the Room we booked was not the same as we saw while booking thru expedia web. Breakfast 6/10.. Next time will not stay at this hotel. overall hotel stay experience 4/10. :O
ID-1936	Hotel and the room is a bit run down, but the staff and the food were really good. Will definitely consider if there's another trip.
ID-1937	Very friendly staff, nice food, quick checkin. Would love to stay here when I visit India again.
ID-1938	HOTEL IS NOT AT ALL GOOD STANDARD FOR THIS PRICE IT CHARGES. IT IS BIG PROPERTY BUT NOT AT ALL TO THE STANDARD MENTIONED.  WIFI WAS NOT AT ALL GOOD. AIR-CONDITIONING WAS NOT GOOD. LOBBY VERY NOISY ,
ID-1939	Stayed for one day only Room very comfortable clean and excellent service.Food quality can be improved
ID-1940	"Everything about the hotel is great except for the bathroom and the location.

The bathroom was tired and worn with no hot water at times.

The hotel is across from the bus stop so very busy.

It is more used for banquet functions."
ID-1941	It's ok for couple of nights. WiFi works. Basic amenities ok.
ID-1942	I love my stay there i will always choose the hotel whenever am in Chennai.
ID-1943	A class stay for family. Take it as for food or location wise stay or atmosphere of surrounding yeah, this hotel property is worth to take a chance guys ....
ID-1944	Not good... A/c was not working .changed room but still had a weak a/c
ID-1945	The hotel is a little further than I expected (25-30 in taxi). That said I didn't want to pay double to stay at the Hilton and the closer hotels, so for the price I was happy. Room was fine. A little musty and smelled of cigarettes but the AC helped clear it out. Didn't have hot water in th shower. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms are quiet so I slept well.
ID-1946	The hotel was really nice and it's clean and tidy with all facilities at good. But the way the staff welcomed us was terrible and they didn't even greet properly. Other than that it's a nice hotel to stay.
ID-1947	We had a great time during our stay. Food and view from our hotel was great.
ID-1948	We loved staying at Leela Palace. Staff were professional in behaviour and friendly as well. It would have been great if the there was access to the balconies.
ID-1949	Very excellent service and hotel
ID-1950	Right from the entry into the hotel to every detail- there are people who serve you with a smile and with so much patience. Loved every minute of the stay. The breakfast spread was awesome and all the people at the Restaurent were so kind and pro-active to serve us. Thanks for wonderful stay.
ID-1951	We received a very warm welcome, and we were provided privileges well beyond the amenities and terms we had reserved for. The front desk receives special mention from us for this. Thank you for your kindness. Every aspect of our stay either met or exceeded our expectations handsomely. We will be back for a longer stay the next time we are in Chennai.
ID-1952	It was absolutely beautiful.  Great service.
ID-1953	"It is a great property with great fitness facility, amazing staff, comfortable room, outstanding buffet breakfast and reasonably priced afternoon tea. 

Staff like Moses were very attentive, courteous and helpful. We enjoyed our staff and sure to visit again."
ID-1954	We planned a unplanned trip to a Leela and we had fantabulous experience at Leela. Food specially is to die for .
ID-1955	We had a delightful time at The Lela in chennai. The hotel building, furnishings and art are lovely. The rooms are large and very comfortable with everything you need. The team members at the concieriege and in the restaurants were very warm and worked hard to ensure we had every need met. The gym is excellent as is the day spa and the pool area was very nice too. We stayed for 3 nights and then came back for another 5. Highly recommend.
ID-1956	Overall hotel is very nice, only they should provide Free WiFi's facility with Room rate
ID-1957	VERY FRIENDLY STAFF IN ALL AREAS, VERY GOOD  INDIAN RESTAURANT DOWNSTAIRS...POOL IS GREAT ...ALSO A SHORT WALK AWAY IS SOME AWESOME CHAI WITH THE LOCALS
ID-1958	great
ID-1959	"Good Service by Staff but Parking wasn't available in Hotel. Had to find a parking outside.
Name of the Hotel is different, pictures are lot different."
ID-1960	The stay was good and the attendants are cooperative. we had nice stay for the value paid.
ID-1961	TOTAL MESS UP BY OYO
ID-1962	Mosquitoes in room and no TV. The big TV subscription expired and morning breakfast was very poor. No towel and blanket. I never suggest this hotel but front office executive is good and friendly. He gave me WiFi password. There are no good hotels near this room to have lunch and dinner.
ID-1963	Comfortable n spacious rooms.. Economical.. Good breakfast.. I would definitely visit again..
ID-1964	Not at all satisfied. Worst possible service received. No towel and soap in bathroom. Management is bad as well. Not at all cooperative. Breakfast is bad. TV and air conditioner is not working. Overall, bad.
ID-1965	If you are a traveller and want places to just crash after a tiresome exploring day, this is the best place to go. Very nice concept for backpackers. Good value for money and nice place to stay. Rooms were clean, awesome breakfast was included in the room tariff. Overall good experience! Thank you Oyo Rooms.
ID-1966	Overall good stay, slightly away from main road but walkable Distance to Pondy bazaar, excellent food, good house keeping issue with hot water during peak hours. Surrounded by grocers and main road around 100meters
ID-1967	Hi MMT lovers, This is a great deal I've got through MMT for this hotel. Place is ideal and location is heart. Simply very good hotel to stay with. Rooms are fantastic and very clean. Service is like star category. They extended few hours during our stay. Very gentle and kind.
ID-1968	First of all ideal centrally located in the city, Very good ambience Well trained staff and good hospitality services for every body and every on from restaurant to room service. Clean property. Well maintained Very warm service from every single person personnel Would like to stay again while I be in Chennai and would recommend specially corporate
ID-1969	Very good. I used to stay regally this is city centre ease moment to all please good food very good reception clean rooms all staff are very close and friendly they allowing late checkout also they have a Vellat Parking also.
ID-1970	Good . .
ID-1971	Nice hotel, good hospitality, clean rooms. Good experience, people welcomed in a good manner.. The service is at best. The atmosphere in hotel is as named Quality Inn. Well maintained and food is enjoyable. You get the best for the money spent. The food is good... Value for the money.
ID-1972	Good . .
ID-1973	Though I stayed only for a night, I felt that most of the facilities in the room are now getting old and need replacement. For ex. The toilet closet was leaking all the time. The door latch was old and I nearly hurt my finger. Small small things which needs to be replaced/ repaired. I had stayed in this hotel for 3 months continuously around 12 years back and feel that all the utilities and fittings are the same.
ID-1974	Good experience, people welcomed in a good manner.. The service is at best. The atmosphere in hotel is as named Quality Inn. :) Well maintained and food is enjoyable. You get the best for the money spent. And the location of the hotel is easy accessible to nearby stores.
ID-1975	This hotel is worth the money. Courteous staff. Economical. Reasonably good complimentary breakfast. It's located in the heart of Chennai namely T. Nagar. Bang opposite kamarajar's ( the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu memorial house.
ID-1976	It a nice hotel to stay in at a good location with nice rooms and a very courteous staff. Food quality is above average but at the same time breakfast buffet was just average. The rooms are clean and at this price it is definitely value for money. I would visit the hotel again.
ID-1977	This was my first stay in this hotel during my recent trip to Chennai. The rooms are ultra spacious and clean, very good restaurants are located nearby, bathrooms are clean, the hotel is value for money if we get discount from travel websites or else other options are also available.
ID-1978	I would not recommend this hotel. Nothing is right toilet does not work and the bathroom is very small. Door not locking and the service is not up to the you have already paid. Lunch buffet was pathetic.
ID-1979	I thought the Quality Inn Sabari is maintaining same quality as it was. It is disappointed. The bed-covers and pillows are smelly. Very bad to stay. Some bad odor was coming from the Pillows. :( I wouldn't recommend. However, the service is good. I will not stay there again.
ID-1980	Nice people to stay with, tries to give best of services. Little old hotel, may need a renovation to do even better. Wi-Fi is not that fast and easy to connect. Must improve upon North Indian main course.
ID-1981	I really enjoyed my stay, and the staff were very friendly!
ID-1982	Stay was great. Only that the breakfast was the same everyday and quite boring. The staff were very polite and humble and help came as soon as we asked. Would be good if regular customers were given a flexible time to check out as some flights depart in the night and hotel rigid check out time is 12 noon.
ID-1983	Overall the hotel facilities were good.  Nice location and not far away from Airport.
ID-1984	"Booked for my visa interview at the US consulate.
Was not expecting much from the hotel at this price. But it was definitely not bad.
Staff are very courteous and helpful.
I am most happiest about the fact that they agreed to a late checkout for me no questions asked. I just had to tell the manager at the reception during my check in and he happily amended my reservation.
Thanks for a pleasant stay!"
ID-1985	Great place to stay....feels like home.
ID-1986	It's a value hotel, offering comfortable stay. I still feel that it's a little overpriced for the amenities and the quality of the room. Food is ok. I think the bathrooms can be spruced up a little more. I asked for a late check out which they offered me, so that was good.
ID-1987	Clean and spacious room. Good and tasty breakfast as complimentary. Wifi is bit slow. Food???? Is ordered from outside. Service staff is very good and cooperative. Hotel???? Is situated at very convenient location, 4 min walk to 10 downing street a very prominent pub in T Nagar.
ID-1988	"Disillusioned by the photos online..very cramped
Shabby place"
ID-1989	"The whole hotel is just one floor of the research park. Power kept going off and the wi-fi was flaky at best. Stay tried their best to help but there experience was not good especially considering there price. 

The room was small. Window was tiny and the room service was OK at best. 

The towels were not soft and they gave just one towel?!"
ID-1990	It is a nice hotel located on the 11th floor of the Tech Park near IIT Madras. The rooms are small but functional. The staff are efficient. The food options in the cafeteria are a little disappointing.
ID-1991	A new experience . One can enjoy self-services. Near to beach also. Very good hotel staff.
ID-1992	Located on the 11th floor of Tech park. Its 'OK' kind of a hotel. The rooms are well kept. Food was good too. There are many options for food. It has a nice view of the city. The staff were hard working. Overall it's a good hotel. Stayed there for business purpose. Wouldn't mind staying there again. It is highly convenient for those who work in the Tech Park.
ID-1993	"Hi

Given the room rates. The hotel is a decent return for your money just for the location. It's proximity to ramanujan IT city is the big plus. The room and facilities are on par for a budget hotel. But definitely clean. The rooms are on the top floor so the lift takes a long time. The staff are friendly. Overall I rate as a 3.5 but only for biz travellers"
ID-1994	Food is not so great other than breakfast, centrally located so transport is no problem. Metro rail station very nearby and metro rail can be seen from the hotel. Laundry can spoil your clothes, once spoiled, they hesitate to compensate guests.
ID-1995	It was nice hotel which perfectly suits my pocket. Food was really an important thing that makes this hotel very famous. It is nicely built though some mistakes. Luxurious rooms and Air Conditioned makes it too cosy. I love the hotel and want to visit it again in my next holiday. Food was nice and room service was all upto expectation.
ID-1996	Hotel looked quite ordinary and I should say hotel should improve its decoration and overall appearance because it was looking very basic and ordinary. Room was very good in space and it was well maintained had quite good facilities, all appliances were working fine. Room services was timely and food was quite good and very nicely prepared. Considering its good facilities it's a good hotel.
ID-1997	I had a good to stay. It's very nice day I enjoyed and we made a birthday party with my girlfriend. Overall it's nice but need some more freedom. Anyways we enjoyed in Jan. If we get a chance to stay, we try to stay again there. The food is good and the room is also good. Nice safety to stay with your betterhalf and the pay is also reasonable. Front office is also nice. Overall, everything in the hotel is good.
ID-1998	I stayed here along with my family and its a good budget hotel located very near to bus terminus. We stayed for sightseeing and food tastes Ok in this hotel. As it is a budget hotel don't expect more from them but the standards of Tata Group are not lost in it. It is located in very convenient place from railway station and bus terminus.
ID-1999	The Ginger Hotel at Chennai is located very near to the corporate hub and IT park. The rooms were clean and service was ok. Overall, I would rate this to be a decent budget hotel for the corporate people and without any hesitation must go for stay if need be.
ID-2000	The overall facilities provided by the hotel was good. The Services and the food rendered by the staff of the resort was upto the mark. The Hospitality towards customers is appreciable. The stay at Ginger has given given a better feel of Chennai and has put a thought of revisiting the same location over again.
ID-2001	You get what you pay for . Good value. Proximity to some it companies
ID-2002	A good hotel and a little bit expensive for the facilities they claim so. Rooms are cramped and we get mugs and buckets to take bath only on request. Housekeeping needs to pay more attention on cleanliness and safety. Parking is not convenient either. Food is pathetic, and we had to go out for food each time.
ID-2003	Stayed in this hotel in the month of Nov 2013. Rooms were neat and clean, well located, near to big software parks. Co-operative staffs, good modern facility like WiFi. Rooms are small. But food is good and is value for money. Rates are justified as per the location.
ID-2004	Very nice stay
ID-2005	Too far from town.
ID-2006	Hotel was nice, the staff was excellent and the service was great, BUT there was heavy construction going in right next to the hotel building. The construction noise was annoying till late night and early morning.
ID-2007	Decent affordable and safe place if you need an inexpensive place to sleep.
ID-2008	Good location , clean , insufficient staff, toilets ventilation is poor .
ID-2009	The hotel is at a convenient location and the rooms are pretty spacious and comfortable, the staff is courteous too. But the rooms have a terrible cockroach infestation, they were in the cupboard, bathroom, on the bed and tables. When we informed the staff, they changed our room, but the new room wasn't any different. They definitely need to get pest control and fumigation done. The buffet breakfast spread is good, otherwise the food is average.
ID-2010	We had a good stay at this hotel. We chose this hotel because it is at walking distance of train station Chennai Egmore. The area around the hotel is lifely. Inside the hotel it is quiet. The room was good and we liked the breakfast, although there were only a few continental options.
ID-2011	A economical stay at heart of chennai Egmore. Food is good, but looks for me a bit expensive to the quantity and taste.
ID-2012	Hotel was decent enough although room was disappointing compared with the lobby and restaurant area. The bar and staff in the basement was good and hotel was in a convenient location. We selected a different hotel when we came back to Chennai mainly because of the reception staff who didn't want to help us get some change for the tuk tuk when we arrived, or help us with onward transportation.
ID-2013	it was very comfortable an enjoyed.
ID-2014	The room allotted to me was neat and clean. The service provided was not much satisfactory. Complimentary breakfast was provided by the hotel. There were no activities organized by the hotel. The surrounding of the hotel was calm and peace. I would like to recommend this hotel to others.
ID-2015	My experience about the hotel was good, I am travelling alone for business purpose. The room service is good, room are very clean and hygiene own restaurant too. The staff are good and it's behaviour with customer is very nice and they served free breakfast and news papaer also.
ID-2016	This hotel is located very near to the Chennai central and is easily accessible. The ambiance of the hotel is good and the rooms are clean. Although the service is good. They need some improvement on this area. The food is good. The reception area has to air conditioned centrally since the climate is hot.
ID-2017	Its a very good hotel near to central station. There service food and everything is excellent, responsible travel desk front office. Very good hospitality in treating guests. Whenever I visit Chennai I used to stay in hotel due to the hospitality of the staff. Last five years continuously I am staying in this hotel only.
ID-2018	Very clean, helpful staff, near the airport and good value for money. Nice breakfast served, a lot of security is installed for making sure of complete security of the visitors. Room service was prompt to attend to our needs and helped us pack our breakfast early morning when we were leaving. And the main thing is the location is very much convenient to commercial areas & the central railway station.
ID-2019	Totally satisfied with the service provided by the staff. Talking about the food, it awesome especially the north Indian. It's situated in the central part of Chennai. It's cheap and affordable for average people. Staff are cooperative and well behaved with their customers. Rooms are neat and clean and service provided by the housekeeping is not too bad. Overall talking about hotel, I would recommend for travellers to opt this hotel for staying.
ID-2020	Best for travelers due to the proximity to the Central Railway Station and the famous old Moore Market of the city. Breakfast (Complimentary - Buffet) was really worth going to the restaurant for. AC works but the rest of the room, spacious though, is budget class.
ID-2021	The destination of this hotel is very nice. The building is very wonderful. Actually I love that place and the room service was good. Bathroom are neat. When I was stayed in that hotel I loved those food. Surrounding location was good. I thank to all of us who served me.
ID-2022	 good quality food
ID-2023	small was very small. limited channels in tv of 40. no bearkfast.
ID-2024	Horrible xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx
ID-2025	My parents and aunt stayed for a couple of nights. The room was comfortable  after they changed rooms due to rattling fans and broken ac!. The restaurant is a mixed one, so staunch vegetarians would want to eat out.
ID-2026	Overall service is good. Awsome location Must visit.. .................................................gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood :-)!!!!!!!!??!????????????????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ..........
ID-2027	Stay is good, pleasant and food also not bad. Very near to central railway station.
ID-2028	Since the advance reservations are made, checking in is swift and pleasant.Rooms are cozy but enough to relax after day sight seeing.a nice place to stay with family within budget limits.
ID-2029	Clean, comfortable and convenient location
ID-2030	Average hotel. Preferred because of close proximity for shopping.
ID-2031	"Food was not good
Cleanliness should be improved
No linen in the bathroom
DTH quality was poor
Hotel ambience was dull."
ID-2032	Towels are not provided in the room for this kind of standard hotel. I have to call room service. The worst part is the towels are like rat bitten at the edges. Very poor.
ID-2033	good stay and good value
ID-2034	Myself and my wife enjoyed our stay very well. As a matter of fact, we regularly visit Chennai in middle of Jan every year and we make it a point to stay in this hotel always. Good staff, good service and good location. .
ID-2035	It's a very good stay. Decent hotel. Busy location. Everything is good about the stay. It's a value for money in such a busy location. Walkable distance from Mambalam station. I strongly recommend this hotel.
ID-2036	Location of the hotel was ideal for our business purpose. Room was also OK. However, there was always a lingering foul smell in the room particularly during the evening and night. In spite of giving complaint, it was not resolved. Service was okay, but required repeated calls. For calling the hotel as Grand, they have to revamp the AC services and other utilities in more specialised way. Other aspects have been graded appropriately as above.
ID-2037	Booked a room for 3 guests and on arrival was given a double bedroom that is too small to put an extra bed anywhere. Hotel staff mentioned this is the size of their rooms and they will remove chairs and table to accommodate extra bed. Hotel manager finally offered a bigger room, if I'm willing to pay extra Rs. 1000. Room was clean though and housekeeping was good. But breakfast as usual was very poor.
ID-2038	Good location. Courteous staff. Value for money. Good food. Comfortable. Since it is located in the business area it is also convenient for people who do trading business. For religious trips also it is centrally located in the city of Chennai. The spacious reception lawn is also an attraction. Transportation from outside the hotel is convenient.
ID-2039	BKR Grand it was a nice experience, staying in the bkr grand hotel. We were enjoyed in our family friends and relatives all the family members. The stay in hotel, food, facilities, cleanliness, value for money, the room and the location we liked and good enjoyment.
ID-2040	Amenities and facilities are items or services hotels offer for their guests. Everything was very good. Nice experience to our family friends and relatives. In and out of the hotel are very good management, customer service, phone responses also good on the day.
ID-2041	Room service, Reception Hospitality, Cleanliness is very poor. Morning Breakfast quality needs lot of improvement. Rooms are also not clean. Service is also below Average. Housekeeping Dept needs Lot of improvement. In Morning breakfast, some more variety items required.
ID-2042	Amenities and facilities are items or services hotels offer for their guests. Everything was very good. Nice experience to our family friends and relatives. In and out of the hotel are very good management, customer service, phone responses also good on the day.
ID-2043	Good hotel at good location. Hotel is situated at famous shopping area in T Nagar. Room are good & clean. Morning breakfast is excellent. The property is well maintained. They have in house separate Veg. Restaurant. Travel desk is also available in lobby.
ID-2044	I just stayed for one night.. I was not able to stay in the room as Bath room was too bad and very bad smell coming from the bathroom... Into the room... Booked for three and I never thought these will provide extra bed on floor.. Very cheap paid 3500, in that case I would have booked two rooms.. Not value for money at all. Only Service was good.
ID-2045	The stay was pleasant, but the facilities that was mentioned in the website was not provided. The welcome breakfast was not given for the reason we came late, whereas it was not informed at the time of Check in about the time till which breakfast will be served. Wifi password was not given. On the whole the service was extremely poor.
ID-2046	High priced small room size, smelly rooms. Good location. Looks great from outside but rooms are not good. Complimentary breakfast is only for a few items, charges for other items. Not good as per the price you pay for the room.
ID-2047	Wi-fi not smooth .. Cleaning may be improved. Also compliment breakfast must be added with some more variety .. Replacement of bed sheet must be atleast alternative days.
ID-2048	At full price and including the taxes, the rates seem slightly high. Best USP are the Car Parking (Though Small and on high occupancy days, you may have problems, Restaurant and Bar). Ideal location for persons having work in T Nagar / Pondy bazaar. Did all my work walking while my car was safe in the parking lot. This area is heavily congested and walking or taking an Auto is best if possible.
ID-2049	Hotel is very good & clean. Hotel person attention is satisfactory. Hotel location is on prime area. I enjoyed & value of money, preparation of foods are good. Over all services satisfied. We can also enjoy purchases by very near market.
ID-2050	Fair facilities
ID-2051	"During last Chennai floods, the hotel provided us with hot water, electricity (using own standby generator), WiFi (for most of the period) and good food. Many hotels in the surroundings did not provide such facilities during this period.
We are thankful to the hotel and the staff."
ID-2052	Really good hotel - convenient to easily go to the shops Restaurant was very good - amazing service. Also had a spa - which was enjoyable after a long day shopping!!
ID-2053	Good location, otherwise the hotel needs some improvement. Broken taps and unavailability of WiFi made my stay unpleasant.
ID-2054	Looking forward to stay again, worth staying here & may be too often with family members or for a business trip. Prime locality, easy accessibility & well connected to move around and wonderful design with very good interiors and good staff and had sweet memories
ID-2055	Stay was pleasant, room is clean and adequate Bath fittings. Service needs to be improved as no food will be served to the room apart from breakfast. Situated in prime location, close proximity to main road. Best part of location is, Thalappakatti restaurant is situated in just around the corner.
ID-2056	Location is good neat to T Nagar where all major stores are there. Also hotel rooms are small but made up good. Breakfast is OK as they are not making there instead getting from outside. Otherwise Bali for money good hotel to stay for 1-2 day.
ID-2057	We have stayed for 4 nights. Room service, ambience and breakfast is good. Location too is in heart of the city. The only drawback is they do not have restaurant. Rest of the things are excellent and I would like to suggest this hotel to my colleagues and friends.
ID-2058	Comfortable reconditioned rooms with shower chamber. Centrally located. Breakfast is average. Taxi and auto easily available. 10 km 1/2 hour drive from airport. T nagar market with major shopping malls is nearby. Krishna sweets. More outlet and Sarvana Bhawan are also closeby at walking distance.
ID-2059	For a single person it is Very nice. Located at very good place to access nearby T-nagar. Options in breakfast are from idli sambar to a variety. Staff from security to manager are all professional & that's great. Wi-Fi is good. Keep going. Value for money.
ID-2060	Other aspects like location, cleanliness, services was OK.. In food quality and in Restaurant menu much more improvement is needed.. I was ordering for mix veg but at 9. 30 PM itself they told that it's sold out. And then I order for outside food..
ID-2061	Well located. Staff were OK. Breakfast was having less number of items. Service was fine. Need a little more cleanliness it is worth the amount for the location Enjoyed our stay there.
ID-2062	When I was reach the hotel by 11. 30pm with stomach, but reception guy arrange me a wonderful food over there with in 20 minutes. Allocated room was very good
ID-2063	Except for some of the basic amenities for which they charge (like toothbrush and paste, soap). This hotel is the best at this price. The room service was wonderful. AC at it's best. Cleanliness and room fresheners were optimum. Flexible policies. Even if you want to extend the stay by 1-2 hours, they accept it.
ID-2064	Room a little congested. Location is great. Staff and especially manager very helpful. Dinning area is very congested. Very limited in room dining options. Need to improve on that. Otherwise enjoyed the stay and location.
ID-2065	Amazing experience. Very clean room. Faster wifi. Wholesome breakfast. Friendly warm staff. Centrally located. You should try. The hotel feels brand new. Will stay there again. The fold was very good. The service was prompt. Gave a chance to order food from outside.
ID-2066	The staff was very friendly and helpful even though I arrived at midnight. I was able to order room service also which was excellent as I was very hungry after travelling. The room was comfortable and very clean. The gym was always staffed with a coach which was very helpful.
ID-2067	Good budget hotel in prime location of T nagar. Although room was very small but still manageable. Should have more space for breakfast in morning as it is really very tight. Overall experience is good.
ID-2068	Worth for money, very neat and clean. As a business person thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Nice service and staff are moving very polite. Very close to all places and nice locality. Reasonable breakfast served. Well maintained hotel.
ID-2069	Overall okay
ID-2070	It was comfortable and value for money
ID-2071	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The room was good and clean. Internet was a bit slow but manageable. Bit far from TNagar shopping, but Auto and Taxis are readily available. Did not have time to try the food.
ID-2072	Just OK...too small bed size
ID-2073	there are two of these hotels, and I went to the other location first, Google maps' fault :). the place is clean well maintained and will definitely stay again. Only issue is (if it matters) it's a little far from the airport. But, early next morning (I only stayed here for a night in transit) I booked Uber for approx 300 Rupees and it took about 30 minutes to get there. it will take much more time if later in day. I left at 7:00 am.
ID-2074	We booked a deluxe room with king bed and gave a standard room with twin beds. We said to the guy it's not my problem. I choosed that hotel only because you have a king bed. After ten minutes, gave us a junior suite with a king bed. Talk when you don't have a good room.
ID-2075	I had to stay overnight and close to the airport. The hotel's location was convenient. Getting taxis for local travel was very easy. The staff were courteous and helpful. However, the single room had no window, hence no natural lighting. Also, the hotel is right on the main road and the noise of the traffic kept me awake as I am a light sleeper.
ID-2076	We rravelles from pondycherry to get bcr flight on nex day. So ... The hotel is very nice and OYO .. Management super and room services and its very near 2 airport ... Very low cost and auper services ... The food have 2 buy But services 24 hours so no need 2 wry and .. 2 OYO
ID-2077	It was good experience with OYO rooms in Chennai. I have been using OYO in Chennai from last 20 days and it is a good experience. We getting prices reasonable and we have not going to faar to search for any hotel. With OYO services we got rooms and rooms also which matches with the ones shown on the website. Complimentary breakfast and wifi is super in all the OYO. Sometimes we may face communication issue but overall it is a good experience.
ID-2078	very happy with the service and the room is very homely. It was a pleasant stay. I would recommend.
ID-2079	Stay was good. We felt home atmosphere. People helped us in locating the places nearby. This is a very good hotel to for a short stay. Suggestion: Lift facilities would make the stay very comfortable. Rates are very reasonable.
ID-2080	Very helpful staff, quick to book autos and taxis, gave good advice on good places to eat out in the local area - we only stayed for one night as the location was convenient to the airport - circa 15 mins by taxi. Overall it was good experience with OYO.
ID-2081	Location of the property is excellent but the rooms may be more appealing.
ID-2082	I Have stayed here for 2 days. Prompt service being provided. Staffs are good. Only issue is the breakfast is being provided from outside. Rooms are good. Staffs are also good for guiding us routes. Overall i have enjoyed the stay. There were some issues but after highlighting those it was rectified by OYO Customer Experience.
ID-2083	I Have stayed here for 3 days. Prompt service being provided. Staff are good. Only issue is the breakfast is being provided from outside. Rooms are good. Staff are also good for guiding us routes. Overall I have enjoyed the stay. There were some issues but after highlighting those it was rectified by OYO Customer Experience.
ID-2084	I booked with OYO for 2 days and my experience with the service provided by them is quite admirable. Just they need to choose hotels along with food facility. I can rate them 6-7 out of 10.
ID-2085	It was really very good at low price. Very good appearance and high level furnisher. Good room service. Front office is also very good. Rooms are good, similar to what is shown in the website.
ID-2086	The price is too high for the type of room I have booked. And it seems they haven't received any notification from hotels.com regarding my stay. Breakfast was below average. But the hotel staffs were very nice and courteous. Hotel doesn't worth a price of 3500.
ID-2087	hotel was excellent,I arrived at 7.30 a.m they had me into a room by 9.00 a.m  check-in was at 12.00,after 17 hours on plane this was greatly appreciated.Very enjoyable stay.Highly recommend it.
ID-2088	Comfortable
ID-2089	"The room was clean. The staff was really nice to accommodate me and get everything I wanted. 
But I think the best part of this hotel is the restaurant connected to it. 
You have to try the chicken lolipops, crispy fried lamb, Hong Kong chicken fried rice, and the best dish by far, the honey chicken. 
I would stay at this hotel again for sure."
ID-2090	"Stay was good, although I was expecting few items available without having been asked, say bathroom essentials.
 newspaper didn't come the 3rd day of stay.. while the one from same day was removed from room ( May they thought I left... ugghh... miscommunication)
Who puts tv remote under the bed while cleaning....
Best thing was free WiFi n there restaurant.. . Nice food..."
ID-2091	Not good
ID-2092	we reached hotel at 0930am they allow us early check in and free upgrade due to non availability of classic room.room was well maintained and clean linen.check in smooth staff was good and polite.
ID-2093	This hotel is situated in the middle of city with clean rooms and comfortable bed. Plenty of autos available  in front of hotel. Decent breakfast spread and food in the restaurant is also delicious. Staffs were helping and courteous.  The only problem I found was the evening traffic in front of hotel which makes it hard to cross the roads. Overall value for money.
ID-2094	The staff was very friendly and helpful, for printouts and directions.
ID-2095	This was my first booking experience through Expedia and the check in was hassle free and we were guaranteed a room earlier than the actual check in time. We are thoroughly happy with the friendly staff. The toilets were a bit cramped but it was very well maintained.
ID-2096	The stay was fantastic with helpful staff members and very comfort stay at chennai...
ID-2097	Nice hotel ,friendly staff central location.nice breakfast.Good Wifi.
ID-2098	The hotel is located fairly centrally with a short drive to anywhere. ( Approx 200 INR to the airport and a similar amount to George Town.) The staff will arrange taxis and explain to driver where he is to take you in Tamil (as most we encountered only spoke Tamil )  Alternatively you can tour around for 4 hours for about 800 INR.
ID-2099	hotel staffs and the managers are very helpfull, restaurant attached to the hotel is very convenient
ID-2100	It was value for money hotel.
ID-2101	Been to Chennai before and stayed in other hotels. So my review is as under- Rooms are clean but the ac and in-room mini fridge was not working efficiently. Single x 2 Cots have 10\" mattresses which make sleeping difficult as beds give a sense of instability.
ID-2102	This hotel is located at T-Nagar. Initially, it was difficult to locate the hotel as it is situated in by lanes, but I called the hotel and asked the driver to know the exact location. Hotel is neat and clean. Everything I found to be OK. The only suggestion is that the complimentary breakfast could be better and more variety can be provided.
ID-2103	The overall experience was good and the hotel is located in the city. The appearance of the hotel was pretty attractive. The staff were very professional and courteous. The room allotted was very good and maintained clean with all essential facilities. There was no delay during sign in and sign out process. I will recommend this hotel to other travellers.
ID-2104	"Everything seemed good. Hotel staffs were helpful.
I didn't get the TV working from second day onwards. It seemed they didn't pay the subscription fee.

Overall, a good hotel to stay."

The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the stay. Thank you!
ID-2111	The hotel was very good and clean. Parking only lite difficult. Other than that everything was good. The break fast and dinner was suprb and the room service was good and then rate also k for the desired room. Really I enjoyed your facility of the room. And every thing was good.
ID-2112	very friendly and helpful staff
ID-2113	One night only was good and comfortable no complaints here
ID-2114	Although the hotel was nice, clean and safe as well as a good location for shopping, the first night we were there we had to use our misquito net. Someone must have left the windows open at some point and the room was infested. The 2nd and 3rd nights were fine. Food at the restaurant was good however they do not cater for international guests when it came to breakfast. With that being said I would still recommend.
ID-2115	Experience was less than the high rating it receives. Staff helpfulness makes up for so much they were exceptional in their eagerness to help with anything they could.
ID-2116	Great hotel with elegant rooms, great food, strong service and convenient location very close to Sipcot Information Technology park. My only disappointment was that there was no hot water in the sink or shower. Stayed for three days and on days one and two informed different hotel staff yet they were unable to resolve the issue by the end of my stay.
ID-2117	Property is good....but very small rooms..no such as a big lobby....but restaurant and pool is very good located breakfast is also good as far as a Taste of food is concerned as i m a pure NOTH INDAIN i wish it could be a better.....
ID-2118	two nights on through way  good for my purposes ..... not much  else to say
ID-2119	Hotel and staff excellent, breakfest was sublime, but the location was really far away from the centre of Madras
ID-2120	"We had a great stay. Hotel is new and very clean. Great amenities. Food is ok.
Excellent staff! Everyone is really nice and accommodating, Kannan (he helped me with my luggages) is worth a mention, what a great and pleasant person!

Only negative note is that I booked for one night through Expedia and I decided to extend  for an extra night and the price i got offered me at the hotel was 2000 rupees more than the one showed on Expedia."
ID-2121	Would recommend for others
ID-2122	really nice
ID-2123	The room is very good, and the service is also very good. If the buffet can provide more choice, that will be perfect.
ID-2124	Functional. were at hotel during a very quire period so don't have experience of service during busy times.
ID-2125	Very nice hotel near SIPCOT  IT park .Very convenient for people are vising TCS and other companies
ID-2126	"A very comfortable room, but lot of mosquitoes which creates a lot of disturbance...
The inroom dining menu is elaborate but the staff are not ready to take order as they clearly refuse to take any order...."
ID-2127	Dirty bathroom.. Not cleaned properly. No bathroom mat.. No security in the night and mediocore breakfast. Room window knob was broken and I couldn't close the window properly.  Access card didn't work late in the night and I had t go back to the lobby manager who was sleeping behind the desk.
ID-2128	Good for one night stay. Breakfast is not available with deluxe room. Cleanliness is OK. Area is very local but the access to the road is high. Street food is available near to the hotel which is good for tourists.
ID-2129	Room Service is terribly slow. For 2 bottle of water had to wait 1hr 30 mins. Lastly, when the water came it was warm, I had asked for cold. Overall, it was not a great experience. Although, buffet breakfast was good. It's a costly hotel considering room service.
ID-2130	Congested rooms, absolutely poor service even at the reception. Overall not worth the money and it was evident that management is negligent about their reputation. Not properly organized and made us wait for half an hour for room keys in spite of having booked in advance. Overall it was a bad experience.
ID-2131	I choose this hotel because of cheap and decent stay, it is nearby the busiest market called T Nagar there you could get everything. Ambience was really nice. All staff are very kind natured. Food is also good and tasty not too much costly. I recommend to stay there.
ID-2132	Best hotel for those who do shopping in Pondy Bazzar, T Nagar. Excellent restaurant for BBQ, quite place and all are at walkable distance. Easy way to exit T. Nagar and proceed to International Airport. This hotel is located center for mount road, Kodambakkam and Egmore.
ID-2133	Happened to visit Chennai and booked a room in IRIS. The hotel is in a very congested place with poor locality. Reception itself made me upset, when I saw the room I was so disappointed that left it within 10 mins. Though the staff at reception were very courteous but rooms are pathetic.
ID-2134	Overall the stay was of great value for money. The location was perfect for my needs. I would recommend this hotel to anybody.
ID-2135	Looking my need, the location of the hotel is idle. Tarrif is quite reasonable. Staff behavior is nice. I have recommended this hotel to my other colleagues who will visit Chennai. The only drawback I found with the hotel is that they do not have any pick & drop facilities.
ID-2136	Nonsense place recommended by make my trip fake ranking. This ranking or the marking for the facility's are all nonsense and done by them as per there comfort and make my trip is just another hell who just put anything on their website and as we trust them they just ruin our trust while talking of the terms and condition which no one ever read
ID-2137	Decent facility good breakfast. Service & billing horrible. Check all the food articles before checking in as you are charged for not using as while checking in the contents were not checked . WiFi does not work, zero connectivity, they forget to put towels & napkins etc ... Than they forget to have room menu, etc ... Location and food only two good parts.
ID-2138	The stay in the hotel was good. The service was very good. The hospitality as a whole is very good. Mainly breakfast and dinner was awesome and tasty. Service and caring towards the guest was really marvelous. Appearance and atmosphere was also nice, I liked it.
ID-2139	Very decent stay ... We stay at this hotel every holidays ... Atleast a week ... Past 4 years ... Good ambience. Good food ... Nice staff ... And really value for our money. Totally much satisfied
ID-2140	Cleanliness is awesome. Extra beds are overpriced. Staff is not willing to adjust check-in and checkout times despite telling them in the extras at the time of booking the hotel. The room service is also poor. I asked them to get 2 water bottles. They took nearly 30 mins and got only 1.
ID-2141	Overall, a good experience. Food at Ali's grill was awesome and very good price. Breakfast and buffet at lunch was what we went for. Hats off to the quality of the food and hospitality. Room was good too, but the third bed was not very comfortable. Toilets are in a bad condition.
ID-2142	I had booked the room by online. I had visited this hotel for alone. All facility was provided in the room. All variety of breakfast was provided in the hotel. The booking and front office was good. The location of the hotel was average. The destination of the hotel was average. I didnâ€™t use activity in the hotel. The behaviour of staffâ€™s was good.
ID-2143	Excellent Hotel, Good Breakfast, Good Service, Helpful Staff
ID-2144	Value for money! Bathroom cud've been much cleaner. Happy with the stay
ID-2145	"Very rude staff

No hotel restaurant was open at 10:15pm. Neither room service.

No help for mobile charger etc. Even mediocre hotels provide mobile chargers to guests."
ID-2146	The room given for hotel.com customers are average. I had ask for replacement by of bed covers
ID-2147	Stay was good. Breakfast is good. little far from airport. No taxi service as per reception.
ID-2148	Cleanliness: time to unblock toilets
ID-2149	"large comfortable rooms, House Keeping should improve,lots of mosquitoes in the room .Quality of food & service standard need improvements. Lots of noise from the floor above due to shifting of furniture etc.
Good staff at front desk and at door."
ID-2150	Restaurant is a bit over-prized, but the hotel staff are friendly and the rooms have good facilities
ID-2151	"Too small rooms. you even can't walk.
Wall to wall fitted bed.
Not value for money."
ID-2152	Communication with the staff was very difficult as they spoke minimal English. They seemed to be unaware they took bookings through Expedia so even though we had already paid they knew nothing about the booking. We almost missed our plane as although we had asked for a large taxi a small one turned up that refused to take us. The room we finally got was a good size but had cockroach's.
ID-2153	Shopping, theatre nearby. Hotel is nice n good. Just no hot flask n no complimetary mineral water. Room access card is always problem. Stay is good
ID-2154	unpleasant stay. not easy task to reach. Morning b/f not at all good. coffee/tea not available..they  go purchase  milk after ordering coffee
ID-2155	I used 3 double bedroom for our family,it was a memorable stay.i would recommend this property for family stay
ID-2156	I am staying here for the second time. So convenient for T-Nagar shopping and after reaching hotel a peaceful stay as it resides in the residential area. Breakfast was home made so what ever I liked it. Rooms were clean and I got everything I want. The rooms are limited and I am fearing going forward getting rooms will be a challenge.
ID-2157	OYO is very hard to find. The helpline is friendly but the information is general. It took us an hour to locate the hotel
ID-2158	good hotel ...good destination..facilities of the hotel is good manitances of the hotel very good food and service was very good .location of the hotel looks very good also front off looks good appreciate and keep up the good work and contiunue to do
ID-2159	Ideal place. If anybody likes to have pure veg food go to Hotel Saravana Bhavan, just walkable distance and Lord Ayyappa Temple and Tower park is very close to this property so we can relax. Very nice to stay. Rooms are very clean. Morning breakfast very tasty exclusively south Indian food is nice. Ampa Skywalk very close from this property. I advise to put a property name board for ease to locate.

ID-2161	As soon as you book the Hotel you are taken care personally by the owner of the Hotel Ms Jaya priya, She is a businesswomen by hobby, Hospitality is her hobby so you don't have to worry for anything, Nice , very clean, comfortable rooms with good services. I would like to stay again.
ID-2162	it was good. Hotel staff are cooperative. When I was feeling uncomfortable health issues, the staff took me to hospital. it was great hospitality.
ID-2163	This could have been a great experience if its not for the incompetent staff. Staff is rude and should work on their professionalism and cordiality.
ID-2164	Had clean rooms. It was in budget, staff was co-operative. Had very good experience.
ID-2165	Not as per the reviews and stars .pictures were very nice but in actual it was opposite.
ID-2166	Stated that the room is with balcony but given without balcony. Stated there is a 32inch tv given was a 21inch tv. Only one set of bath n hand towel given when there is 2 guest. The front desk didnt have a basic courtesy. The wifi is working. The
ID-2167	"Clean room and a good shower, plenty of hot water.
Good customer services. Helpful front desk.

Room service is available. There is no lunch/evening restaraunt.

Well organised breakfast, plenty of room to read the daily newspaper and have breakfast in a leisured manner. Very enjoyable."
ID-2168	The hotel was pleasing but the price point was a little too high. The staff was generally very friendly.
ID-2169	Best place to stay with good food varieties and room service.Rooms are a bit small but convenient enough to stay.
ID-2170	Recently, I booked this hotel for my parents and siblings. They had a wonderful stay! The customer service was exceptional and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The food was fantastic! We highly recommend it to anyone who would prefer a calm and quiet stay in Chennai. It is an oasis of peace in the middle of a busy city. Overall, excellent! We will return again to this place.
ID-2171	I have stayed at many hotels in the past, but none of them can stack up to the comfort and atmosphere of Hanu's. The breakfast was amazing, the hotel staff were polite and rather accommodating especially a manager named Praveen. Overall the hotel was one of the highlights of my trip to Chennai.
ID-2172	The property is located in most posh part of the city, and has quaint homely feel. The staff is super efficient and available round the clock. Although, a bit old property, well-managed and upkeep as per best standards.
ID-2173	Hotel is at nice location, nice environment, tasty food. Only the service part was slow, if you order something you have to wait for minimum half hour. Behaviour is nice, food has genuine rates. Rest was OK.
ID-2174	Awesome and mind blowing, it was pleasure staying at that place. So guy's plan banate hain hum sab theek rahega sir please thanks sir sure Mam will follow karo dhoni thanks sir have already informed Nagesh please share your opinion.
ID-2175	This property is located close to the Tamil Nadu CM and Thalaivar Rajinikanth's house and you can expect tight security. Safe, silent and lots trees around away from the traffic noise. Rooms are very clean and has good facilities and hotel staff were also very courteous. Only let down for me would be the food can do better.
ID-2176	We went to Chennai for Visa interview and this Hanu Reddy Residences is near to US consulate. We checked in around 3:30 pm and the people in the reception were very courteous. Even at that time, they served good food. Thanks to the staff for that. We ordered Onion pakoda for evening snacks and it was yummy. Dinner [Phulka and Paneer curry] was hot and tasty. Breakfast was decent. Overall it was a pleasant stay.
ID-2177	Awesome Experience!!! Love the Stay. The facilities were too good. Location is very calm and serene. Lovely Food too. Overall lovely experience. Love the place love the place love the calmness there.

ID-2179	I wanted a decent place for my friends to stay for a birthday party at affordable rates and this is it. Well maintained, good staff, clean and great value for money. It's centrally located so you have everything at walkable distance from malls to foodie streets to the state CM house. Great for business and one night travellers.
ID-2180	The hotel was located in the city. I was satisfied with this hotel stay. The check in and checkout was not delayed. The room was neat and clean. There were no activities arranged by this hotel.
ID-2181	The room is very clean. The hotel fully surrounded my trees which is more pleasant and very good to see. I am happy to recommend this residence those who like to stay in chennai. .
ID-2182	It was relaxing feeling here in this property. Was pleasantly surprised with silent ambiance and peaceful avenues around this place though it is located in the centre of this capital city. Very fairly priced. Small restaurant and kitchen needs an hour to serve in rooms. It's a clean and good place. Liked it.
ID-2183	It was a very comfortable stay. The place seemed a bit old on the outside, but inside the rooms is a beautiful and comfortable and fresh stay. Loved the stay and would repeat this again, if I get another chance. The only snag I had was with hotel staff not being able to give things on time, when I asked, but they were courteous anyway.
ID-2184	Ideal hotel if you are going for US visa. Great location, great homely place and excellent service. It's right behind the Chief Ministers house. Clean location. The place is very peaceful and the staff is helpful. One advice for visitors is to order food well in advance as they take about 30+ minutes to deliver.
ID-2185	It was a horrible experience. I don't know why MMT refers such filthy places. It spoils the credentials of MMT. It can be just termed as a guest house. Improved version of dormitory. Floor is with old styled tiles. Not even a carpet. AC does not work. A ceiling fan in room which makes hell lot of noise. Old styled bath room with an electric geyser In short horrible recommend MMT to remove from its list..
ID-2186	An Old Bungalow/ House, converted into a spacious hotel. Very comfortable, spacious rooms, with clean bathrooms. A limited breakfast spread, but quite tasty food with live counters. Was here for 6 days & the staff were very friendly & courteous, WIFI- Not working for the entire duration. Toiletries, can definitely improve given the amount they charge to the customers. Overall, stay was very relaxing.
ID-2187	Hi I used to stay there for one week, it primary location in OMR main road, cleanliness is average and more secure area to stay with family. It is reasonably OK for Manet value. Thanks for Makemytrip online portal for their reasonable concession.
ID-2188	The electrical connections were not good and were not fixed even after complaining. I was given a extension board instead. Other facilities were good. The location of the hotel is good and behaviour of staff is also good.
ID-2189	The hotel was good. However they can make it more easy for the customers to find it by putting up sign boards. Facilities were okay. No WiFi was given. No food facility was given! Staff was cooperative. In all they could have done much better!
ID-2190	Have to improve lot in their service.. No proper power back up service. Couldn't find any dining service... But fine stay for business trip for their accessibility.. Overall average experience not bad.
ID-2191	It was really a bad experience, the staff are not cordial at all, both of the managers are bad people, don't even know to behave with the guests properly. The guest house claims to provide internet service through WiFi but I guess the speed is slower than our 2G Mobile Internet.
ID-2192	Average stay. Easy accessible location in omr. Rooms were in OK condition. Facilities were fine. Rate was little high compared to other same type hotels near by. Prefer to take this hotel again as it is easily accessible.
ID-2193	Hotel does not have any facility as lift, cleanliness, staff boy. Even do not have name board on building. Manager is 80 yrs old person who strictly says talk to makemytrip as you booked via them, don't complain to me. Also he had used very bad language. Simply not recommended.
ID-2194	Except small maintenance problems, Total stay was good and Nice. Staff response is good. Affordable cost. But the need to improve the maintenance littile bit. Very near to the transport facilities.
ID-2195	Old apartments used as hotel. Manager is not professional at all, argues harshly. Too many rules and regulation. Other good hotels are there for same price opt for them. If spending a night with roof above your head is your concern then go for it or just stay away.
ID-2196	They don't know what hotel service is at all. Hardly any room service is there or they provide. The positive point is the location but nothing else you can expect what you can normally look for in a hotel service. But for a day's accommodation, it's ok. Not advisable for longer stays.
ID-2197	 not suitable for family
ID-2198	Very poor quality food & drink, facility is worst and no room service available. Their behavior is like they are very disappointed as we come to stay at there place. This is the worst guest house I have visited ever in my life. In my opinion no one should book that guest house.
ID-2199	Rooms are good. Service is quite ok. DON'T Know if its the flood effect or not but internet through wifi always shows limited connection & the staff were not able to fix it else everything is ok. Location is perfect for foodies as it is just opposite to barbeque nation & another excellent one is 'sangeeta'.
ID-2200	This place has really very good ambiance. The hotel front staff was very friendly and professional. This is budgeted property. They have free Internet for 24 hours. The room size was very big. Room was cleaned and well in presentation. Bathroom was very good. Drinking water was also good in quality. AC was working fine. It is in the heart of the city. Very well-connected to main road of the city.
ID-2201	 average services
ID-2202	If you are lookin for a Ã©conomiq stay prefer this..or just move on
ID-2203	Rooms should be more cleanlier.There was no A/C in the morning . room was full of mosquitoes.
ID-2204	Pleasant
ID-2205	Nice stay. Complementary breakfast was good. Overall experience is satisfactory.
ID-2206	If you are relaying on the internet then this is not the hotel
ID-2207	No Bath room towels and good soap. Cleaning to be improved. Service courteous and helping. No parking facilities. Can be improved. Narrow toilets too. As it is city easy to commute. Near Anna Salai too. Can assist in parking. Narrow entrance and no board to show it.
ID-2208	The destination of the hotel was good. The location of the hotel was good. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout was not delayed. The overall service of the hotel was good. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel. The food was nice with quality and quantity. There were no activities arranged by this hotel. I donâ€™t have any suggestion for this hotel.
ID-2209	However, we never got to stay at the hotel. We had a situation that caused us to leave Chennai the night before. I am sure this was a good hotel.  Please convey to the hotel management our sincere regrets. Thanks.
ID-2210	I had visited this hotel for personal purpose. The food quality was average in the hotel. The activities were not arranged by the hotel. The location of the hotel was good.

ID-2219	wifi doesnt work. no parking. took 2 hours to give extra bed.
ID-2220	hand a wonderful time
ID-2221	Have stayed about 10 days off and on. Staff are friendly but loud on 1st and 4th floor. Don't forget free breakfast staff will not tell you.
ID-2222	The guest house is conveniently located to the US OFC center (by walk: 15 mins - next lane) and to the US embassy (by bus: Rs.11, 20-30mins by auto: depends on how you bargain :)). The bedsheets, room and bathroom are clean. The walls appear worn out though. Wifi is slow. Simple, pleasant stay- expect no frills. Good Veg food is available (7am - 10:00pm) at the veg restaurant downstairs.
ID-2223	No parking available at the hotel which causes inconvenience to people traveling in their vehicles
ID-2224	Stayed here for couple of days. Room was not spacious. The hot water facility was a joke. The water was no where even close to being warm. However the room was very clean and the location was close to the biggest shopping hub in Chennai. They have a vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor. The food was good and the restaurant was clean.
ID-2225	Not so good facilities and no hot water and no internet in my floor where I was staying but room is good and location is far but for my last trip it's quite nearer to my work place.
ID-2226	Have checked in for 2 days. Good location and value for the money. There are few complaints but every hotel will have some. For example WiFi wasn't working, hot water wasn't coming properly, Power fluctuations was there. But they are all minor priority for me. Overall the place is good and I liked the breakfast and staff behaviour.
ID-2227	Good location, good breakfast, good service, good hospitality had pleasure stay but only one thing a/c is working but ceiling fan is not available, surrounded smell of cigarette smoking in room. Overall good and worth of money this is the second time I could stay there.
ID-2228	Worth place. Cheap price we can get good service. Thanks to make my trip. Decent and clean environment. Flexibility to check out timing. Hotel staff are good. Gid food. But repeated menu. Compare to cost its good.
ID-2229	I stayed 2 days in this hotel. Staff is very friendly and talking politely. Complimentary breakfast is ok. Car parking has very limited space. Room cleaning and maintenance was nice. I feel restaurant food rates are bit high in this hotel, anyway we have Domino's and other restaurants are there near this hotel.
ID-2230	We booked for 1 night via makemytrip with breakfast. Breakfast was pathetic and we skipped and choose to eat outside. We told the reception we might extend for a day, they immediately changed the availability in make my trip to sold out and we had to pay 500 extra to book the room for next day, than what we paid via makemytrip.
ID-2231	Stay at Kings Cross residency was awesome. Room was good and clean. Hotel services like Wi-Fi and complementary breakfast was good. The location of the hotel was nice accessible to taxi and bus services.
ID-2232	Was a one day stay. Nice location. Easily accessible. Nice room, clean, spacious and good service. Nice breakfast too, was complimentary and had many options. Cons- Bad WiFi service and TV has close to no channels. Almost nothing is subscribed into.
ID-2233	Its a Nice place to stay. The same is more of a guest house and require to graduate as a hotel. Basic requirement like a restaurant is not there. Bought out food through room service is very average. The complement breakfast lacks variety. Wi-fi service is poor. But the stay was otherwise comfortable. Rooms and toilets are small but clean.
ID-2234	Clean, worth the money, cosy and perfect location. The only area that needs improvement is the restaurant and services in F&B. The feel of the stay is Star category and the hotel is very good value for money.
ID-2235	Stayed in hotel for a day, there was flexible check-in and checkout time. Staff is courteous. Free internet and location is awesome. Service was good but not excellent. It's a good budget hotel with cleanliness maintained. Staff was courteous and good thing was flexible check-in/out timings.

ID-2239	Well maintained rooms.. Small rooms though... Fully ac...food is decent... A good hotel. Value for money.it is well connected by bus and train.bathrooms are ok. They ll giv only soap, shampoo and brush
ID-2240	Room are neatly maintained and staff are very helpful. The hotel location is good and it is close to shopping centers. Breakfast is good, although not the best. Would recommend staying at this hotel. Also need to make sure you let them know if there is a change in check in and check out times.
ID-2241	It was a fantastic stay in Hotel Nachiayappa Park Hotel. Room was clean, bathroom was also clean and good ventilation. The hotel's members were very polite a friendly. They behave in a professional manner. The food provided was hygienic and delicious. Good location. The hotel is worth for money.
ID-2242	Situated at the busy heart of the city, this place is very clean. No hassles like other places. Nice customer service. They were very responsive even at late night. Decent and clean rooms. Great value for money.
ID-2243	We stayed here for two nights. The hotel lies in what you can call the business area, which means the price will not be the lowest but it is very convenient since many restaurants are around. There was friendly staff and decent rooms. The only real downside was that we had no view at all (ie. A brick wall).
ID-2244	It's a very good location, No restaurant,, Bad staff Not so clean, No proper amenities, No proper network and WiFi. No laundry, The bathrooms are so stinky and they need to be well treated, Overall the hotel is just satisfied for the money I paid.
ID-2245	The service was very poor and for each and everything I was made to chase and get. Room service was bad, concern managers with inefficient communication and coordination. In the past it was good and currently the management is not caring and focus sing only on collecting more money.
ID-2246	SUPERB Location, we get all the necessary items there like shopping, tranportation, food, etc. Hotel premises was good to stay. Management was too good, they were supportive and very helpful to us. I would like to stay there whenver I visit Chennai.
ID-2247	Centrally located in T Nagar. Very near to Hotel Saravana Bhavan, Ranganathan street and all major shopping spots like Pothys, Saravavana Selvarathinam etc ., There is no restaurant and room service for food in this hotel, but it is not an issue because of nearby Saravana Bhavan. Bar is available. Spacious rooms. On the total, it is value for money.
ID-2248	Very Comfortable stay in Chennai at economical. The Bus stand is very near and walk-able distance. Excellent location for shopping. All shopping are around 1 km only. The hotel service also good. I am satisfied for shopping and all memorable places. Very Good.
ID-2249	Hotel room is just stinks, location is okay. Air conditioner is not working properly. Cupboard is dusted. No toiletries have given except soap. Totally it's not worth for money. I never recommend this hotel.
ID-2250	Good people good person nice job good exprience. Second time i book this hotel its a nice. I suggess all person take a exprience 1 time to niciappa hotel ittttttttttttts toooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooood i like ittttttttty
ID-2251	Food not good and breakfast not available in the hotel. Where hotel was placed, it is was excellent. All shopping needs are around 1 km only. I am satisfied for shopping and seeing all memorable places.
ID-2252	One of my close friend referred this hotel and I booked it. Even after checking in our room, the room was not cleaned properly. There is no helpline numbers to contact reception, service, etc. No towels, soaps and accessories provided, after a big fight with receptionist, they provided towels and soaps after 20 mins. Worst service ever.
ID-2253	vfdsfsdfgdgdsgsdgsdddddddgfggfjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
ID-2254	Stay was good at this price. Location is near market. Clean....... . .... ......................................................................................................................................................................
ID-2255	"From my side this is not food to stay in this hotel with family.

Hotel rooms are not clean, charges are high that compared. 

Hotel staff has to learn lot of things. 

Hotel has to work hard on many things."
ID-2256	This is a basic Hotel. The price was a little higher for the standard of this hotel. Bathrooms were not that clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. They charged for 3 persons per room but for the third person they gave only a small mattress without the bed and expected us to put the mattress on the floor and sleep which this is very bad. when asked they said that this is the policy of the hotel.
ID-2257	One of the worst dirty hotel, stay away from this hotel. Room blanket is spotted with yellow spots, towels are old and the worst is bathroom where you can see yellow spots. stay away from this hotel
ID-2258	room is clean,maintenance is good,airport services is excellent.
ID-2259	good place to consider.the quality of linen looks dull.bright and spot less linen would be appreciated if maintained.the only complaint is reservation was not found on the system and this delayed the check in process.if not it could have helped us save more time
ID-2260	Except that the place is close to Chennai airport, nothing is noteworthy. Rooms was not clean. The flush mechanism didn't work and no effort was made to repair the faulty mechanism. No elevators. Only good thing is that they provide free pick up and drop from and to Chennai airport.
ID-2261	Very closed to the airport
ID-2262	Such a poor pick up arrangement, pathetic reception area, noisy surroundings, dirty room, no wardrobe, poor quality chair & table
ID-2263	Good considering its location but still could have been better for the price they charged. Service was good and would recommend for someone aboarding a flight.
ID-2264	Its a good experience.
ID-2265	Rooms were never cleaned, full of mosquitoes. Worst choice in my life
ID-2266	Rooms are not clean. I think they never clean the bathrooms and bedsheets also. Room service is horrible we need to wait for at least 30 min for any kind of service.
ID-2267	It is on a good location and the staff are courteous. I checked in early as i had to check out early, but they charged me an extra 500 rs. Also, in the room, blankets and pillows had foul smell and toilet jet was not working.
ID-2268	Receiving of reception and clarity of info delivered is not proper. Rooms are upto the mark. Need to improve the appearance from outside. It is not good, may be due to old construction. Other than that everything is fine. Food delivered is upto the mark.
ID-2269	Bathrooms were not good, though bearable. Der was no lock in bathroom then we waited while they adusted the lock and flush and shower was not working and their was a hint of foul smell too
ID-2270	I stayed in the hotel for a client meet and the experience was really wonderful. I don't think I really cared about the amenities other than the basic ones. The rooms were quite nice. The mattresses in the rooms were the nest a hotel can have. This was the best hotel I have ever visited. You will get a complimentary breakfast for sure. Which is a good one.
ID-2271	Service is good and it is easy to locate. Food is okay and other amenities, provided are just okay. As there aint much better options in this area, at reasonable price. So its better to stay in Oyo. Which provides quality rooms at a reasonable prices.
ID-2272	The experience was fantastic..the service of front office stuff is awesome. The room service was fantastic...the management was not at all worried about the payments ..instead they were concern about the well being of their guests...we have been to India especially Chennai several times and never experienced such a great service....starting from cleanliness all major aspects were perfect.
ID-2273	I had a good time at the hotel, I would certainly recommend for others. I would suggest to book this hotel through yaatra for a reasonable price. If you have not come to Chennai for leisure stay, go for it. So guys go for it if you are on official purpose!!
ID-2274	I stayed there for 4 days. It is a good hotel. Staff behaviour was very good there. There was no delay in check in and check out procedure. Room was okay with all amenities. They all were in working condition. Food was good. All facilities were good there. No activity was there. They should have been added activities in this hotel. I travelled there single in November 2013 for roam around and for work.
ID-2275	The location is close to the bus stand and it is within the city. The rooms are of AC and the service is excellent, the room was booked in advance. Food is good and bar facility is available. Parking space is available. Wifi is available and it is recommendable hotel to others.
ID-2276	It was 5 days stay at Thulasi Park Hotel, it was situated at main city and there were basic facilities in the room and also spacious, food was tasty with lot of variety, we weren't used the activities organised in the hotel, there were enough space for parking. Overall we enjoyed the stay and all in all.
ID-2277	That hotel was very nice but water was very salted i got a allergic problem in using that water food and all also not bad room boy and everything is not nice near kodambakkam it is famous area of chennai all actors is here only my girl friend also happy a/c room is good only
ID-2278	The Staff at front office and F&B were extremely gracious, their friendliness and hospilaity made me feel as if I was at home.
ID-2279	Solid option close to the airport. Not all restaurants open. Accommodating staff.
ID-2280	"Our stay at zone was pretty good. Staff were super amazing all the way from front desk reception staff (who even helped negotiate the rickshaw scooter rate for us) to the staff at the restaurant. Amazing people. 
I wished they would take more care of the mosquito issue though. Too many in the building."
ID-2281	The service was so good that it was a little bit overbearing at times.
ID-2282	It was great to stay at Zone....
ID-2283	A good place for comfortable stay.
ID-2284	Hotel Gokulam Park, Chennai - Very good location, nice room, good & courteous staff and service, Front Desk very help full. Everything about the hotel is fantastic except that in bathroom & tea kettle I found small type cockroach which raised health concerns.
ID-2285	The rooms looks like a old and very small poorly maintained. Because we found couple of bed bugs... Air conditioners are very old and it stopped working and making sounds frequently suddenly. Swiping not working while opening door. Restaurant food or not good average and server are also not enough knowledge.
ID-2286	The rooms appeared to be very old and poorly maintained. Air conditioners are very old and it stopped working intermittently. Furnitures were shabby. Location was okay. The room size was very small. Bathrooms were not really neat and clean.
ID-2287	A budget hotel in nice location ( Ashok Nagar, Chennai), good staff and breakfast at rooftop restaurant is served fresh and good quality food. Location of Hotel is also at key location and convenient for all, The rooms were well maintained, Best value for money ..
ID-2288	Basic room and facilities. Decent food and breakfast options. Good for short business trips. Room service is a bit slow, need to follow up to get your food. Convenient if your business is around the location.
ID-2289	Please ignore this. They are do many options in this city. Poor service, poor maintenance, no TV channels, no response on your requests. Absolute waste of money. Just for location close to airport and very easily located... Nothing else I mean..
ID-2290	I visited Chennai in the month of September 2015 and stayed in this hotel. It was convenient to locate the hotel and it was in centre of the city. There was no delay in check in and checkout. The room allotted to me was spacious and it was well maintained with all required amenities in working condition. Overall, I was satisfied with the stay.
ID-2291	Hotel is good. Well-maintained and correct value of money. Service was also good. Rooms were small and comfortable. Trip was wonderful and memorable. Hotel also help with travel facilities which made it more convenient.
ID-2292	This is kind of good budget hotel for people who doesn't want to afford 3 stars. Considering to pricing services, cleanliness are satisfactory. Quality of the food served, food menu and prices are is good. Room service is well enough to satisfy the customer.
ID-2293	All services are excellent and staff also helpful. Mr Khan is very important and interesting to know how to manage in Chennai. So I will always support and stay in Hotel Golulam Park.
ID-2294	You can't get more than the available facility for the money we pay. Awesome. Breakfast spread is ordinary but tasty. Sound proof glass required as we can hear honking noise clearly since the location of hotel is on the main road.
ID-2295	Extremely satisfied with the service and the quality of the room. Food was good, location is very good so it's a very good deal. Car parking is not adequate and that is the only problem other wise it's value for money.
ID-2296	Well I asked these guys for a booking over the counter and the price they told me was nearly double that of Makemytrip! Place is clean and decent. Staff are ok (they were creating unnecessary problem during check-out). Food is ok too.
ID-2297	I had to do a short stay along with my wife in Chennai for some personal work. Gokulam park is a wonderful choice for it - given the location, staff courtesy, south Indian food, room amenities, etc. Rooms could have dark curtains. I would recommend this hotel for this price than other hotels nearby.
ID-2298	Nice to stay with their.......................... .. .... ...
ID-2299	Located in the heart of the Kashmir Valley, which is called 'Paradise on Earth', SrinagarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landscape is interspersed with greenery, lakes and hillocks. The city is spread out along the banks of the Jhelum River and is famous for its surrounding natural beauty and postcard tourist spots. The two parts of the city are connected by nine bridges. The Hari Parbat and the Shankar Acharya hills lie on either side of the city.
ID-2300	I stayed for three days, got good response but the food din't go well. As my taste was fully bombayish.. The hotel doesnt provide buffet spread, but was very satisified with the south indian breakfast, a different taste, but very less.. Sabse bada pet lekhin kam khaana, alag pura bahoth acha sa prop. Pura satisfied ho, In pondi bazar, had good entertainment, luv chennai!! Thankz for the gift!!
ID-2301	Room was clean and comfortable.
ID-2302	Not worth for the money paid. Toilet commode and pipe fittings need immediate replacement.Toilet flooring and wall pianting need to be improvised.       Bed matress is really good .  Wish to see a better breakfast menu.
ID-2303	Not bad
ID-2304	Nothing much
ID-2305	No very good hotel
ID-2306	very arrogant and unpleasing receptionist unfit to hold a post in hospitality. Shouting against a guest in a hotel charging 3700/ per day is unheard in the annals of hotel industry. I never forget the humiliation met with and really want to make a serious complaint but to whom? .
ID-2307	I do not want to trust this website,I booked a hotel and after going hotel they told rooms are not avaliable.They told they will refund the money which they didnt do.I called after few days and spoke to customer service they said they have to it manually and its a technical prob ..its like wasting of my time calling customer care again and again
ID-2308	Ok
ID-2309	Food is very expensive
ID-2310	The service staff should be more customer centric and the bath space is too small to even stand and take bath.
ID-2311	The room is small. Bathroom is too small. It is not very clean. Accessibility to the hotel is not very good. It is in side road. A/c was not working. Breakfast is served in the room and you have to eat in the bed (:- you have to give the car keys to the security as the car is parked outside, check out is 24hrs from the check in time.
ID-2312	Staff are really helpful, they treat you with great hospitality. Cleanliness in the premises which make your stay more comfortable. Convenient location. Definitely value for money.
ID-2313	The room was very nice, although, the bed was stiff as a board. That actually worked out well, I slept very well. The breakfast room is very small, but that gave me the opportunity to share conversation with a stranger. The breakfast buffet was limited, but really delicious and fresh, high quality items were served.
ID-2314	it was good for short stay..
ID-2315	I originally booked a room for one person; then I corrected the booking for two persons with two beds.   They said they did not receive the second, corrected request.  Promised a room with two beds, but manage, Mr. Anand, initially reneged in an unpleasant way.  ok resolved.  Noisy clientel; quality of breakfast not high.
ID-2316	Staff were not friendly - the room we booked was in anouther building- beds were worst I've ever slept in- breakfast was minimal-
ID-2317	Wifi is practically non existent
ID-2318	This hotel is best for shopping, balaji temple, different food joints. Etc. Chennai famous pondy bazaar is 2 min walk away. Staff is very good. Rooms are big size. Good choice in breakfast which is free.
ID-2319	I called room service to collect my laundry. One person came and without even knocking, he unlocked the door with their master key. Chain was hooked or else he could have entered the room directly. Rooms in hotel are meant to be private but here its not. Don't know with how many people they have done this and apologized. Good luck for your visit.
ID-2320	I suggest to everyone never ever go here. The pics of good hotel and good rooms but gave room in a guest house rooms like servant quarter very bad staff. They fights with a customers. Never ever go to this hotel.
ID-2321	Different treatment for online makemytrip booking and direct hotel on site booking. Particularly on check run-out times. On line 12-12pm and for direct 24 hours. Most international flights lands at early morning. Then this 12pm in and outs are troubling for onward flight travels in the same day evenings. Local bookings are saved from this situation.
ID-2322	Good hotel located very near to T. Nagar main shopping area, rooms are neatly maintained. Staff are good and polite. Service is good. Food is good. Definitely value for money hotel. Especially, for stay with family.
ID-2323	The hotel staff is very cooperative and excellent in service. We requested for spiceless food for our older parents and they obliged and prepared the same. The executive rooms are spacious and very clean. It was great value for money with makemytrip discount.
ID-2324	Very good location and comfortable rooms. Courteous staff and good complimentary south indian breakfast served. Welcomed well and accepted for little extra hours of stay. Limited as well as unlimited variety of food available for lunch and dinner.
ID-2325	Excellent location in central T. Maharashtra, great accommodation and facilities at right price. Good quality breakfast and good restaurant. Great to have a WiFi facility. People are courteous and helpful.
ID-2326	Ek dum horrible hai hotel Kabi be yaha koi na jaye photo kuch dhikhaya hai jaa k Ganda sa room dete hai full of gande room Gandhi service or Ganda sa Khana I suggest to every one its a fake pics or fake every everything. Please never ever go here in life
ID-2327	Very bad staff ugly hotel he shown me a good pics in here but given me a bad room full of mosquitoes smelly very bad staff very bad food quality he shown the pics of hotel on road but given the room in back side cottage ugly rooms never ever go to here again
ID-2328	Hotel is not interested to a lot rooms to those who comes through online. Check in time delayed more than 6 hrs. Asking us to wait in lobby. Next day getting call and asking when we vacating the room before 24hrs.
ID-2329	Hotel is close to the T Nagar shopping area. Our objective of value for money was achieved- both in the shopping and the hotel charges. We got an upgrade without asking. Recommended for families.
ID-2330	Better & cheap good facility. It has good staff, food facility
ID-2331	The location and service personnels were awesome. The rooms were clean and tidy. Only thing was we were provided rooms in an adjacent building and not on the main one. Hope it ll be wiped out next time.
ID-2332	Stay were pleasing and courteous. When booked online it is a 1 pm 12pm checkout. There is hot water facility and restaurant available at the ground floor high serves good quality food, though it is slightly on the expensive side. Overall it's a good package.
ID-2333	"Bath room had leaks, decorative condition of bathroom
Poor. Staff are very helpful."
ID-2334	I had was searching for a room for 3 adults & this hotel popped up on my screen. I went ahead with the good reviews it had
ID-2335	Overall it was ok. Walkable distance for shopping in TNAGAR. Easy access to airport & Railway station. Non-smoking rooms.
ID-2336	Its was awesome place to stay.
ID-2337	Nice place for business travellers.. Very friendly staff
ID-2338	Nice at residential place
ID-2339	"spacious enough.
toilets are good.
kitchenette with no crockery; not even a spoon.
A/c is functional but control not working.
matress is not comfortable."
ID-2340	Too many Mosquitoes, late check in, warm room, fridge not working, no light over vanity mirror, bed  too  soft, disturbed at the middle of the night by a errand boy, dirty swimming pool, curtains don't cover the full windows, balcony chairs uncomfortable, no information about complimentary tea, breakfast not part of the package, no lights on the beach, no tea kettle, bath shower low force, no hand towel, no complimentary fruits, snacks or drinks
ID-2341	Quality of service is too bad. We arrived 12.30pm actually our check in time is 12.00pm. They said wait for sometime we waited until 1.00 and then reached room
ID-2342	"I am really sorry to tell u that this is one of the worst resort i have been in my life, i request hotels.com to look into the property before they option it out for booking.

I am regular traveller thru which my bookings are done on hotels.com.This one really pathetic."
ID-2343	The room and ambience inside is good. But bathroom needed a towel rack near wash basin. Taps were leaking. There were many flies in garden area. Room service is pathetic. Breakfast was not good and food was cold. The pool was not clean. The towels were stinking
ID-2344	"Staff helpful and approacheable, friendly
Facilities  had to be serviced regularly like water heater.
Swimming pool cold
Beach was good. Overall good to r and r"
ID-2345	It was a great place to spend 4 days with my family. The food quality needs improvement in both diversity and quality. Not all room extras like kettle and tea or coffee were availed. Otherwise a comfortable stay with good facilities including a clean beach.
ID-2346	Room is in excellent maintenance, but room service was poor where I asked change of bed cover and iron box but they have not provided me that after calling more than 3 times also. I booked luxury villa but it has lot of lizards, horrible Bath tub where it contains lot of red worms and not maintained properly, also complimentery breakfast is just OK, nothing special, idli, vada, dosai as usual ..
ID-2347	Hotel Rooms are well maintained. But food service and taste are not so well. The hotel is situated in the beach. So you can have fun and enjoy. If they concentrate on developing the taste of food its value for money.
ID-2348	Room service, everything is Good and especially location. Swimming pool is awesome and one more thing maintenance is so nice and clean!! Little disappoint with management regarding booking moreover this resort is nice.
ID-2349	VGP is Good place for one day holiday. Nice beach facing resort for both friends and family visit. Very refreshing. Food can be better with better quality and options
ID-2350	Happy stay, nice ambiance, in the morning breakfast is just OK, room is worth for money and little bit hot on that day so we can't enjoy the climate. Rooms are good with jacuzzi, swimming is nice but the place is not right.
ID-2351	Nice location. Spacious rooms. Staff were very courteous. Can be maintained better. I had to change three rooms from the time of allotment of my room as the rooms were very untidy and stinking. Room service was very poor.
ID-2352	The room was good except for the bathroom where the shower and other facilities couldve been a lot better. The front office staff were courteous enough. However the cost for the stay should have been lesser, it was a tad bit high compared to many other resorts around.
ID-2353	I have checked in on 2nd July. We booked 3 rooms. AC not working and TV remote not working. Stinking smell on all rooms. Bath room are very bad. Lot of stains. I recommend not to go this resort. And breakfast and evening tea kadai snack when we had the food immediately reacted on our back. Stomach upset for 4 people out of 6. Lot of flies on the food serving area. Local stall food is more hygienic than this VGP resort food.
ID-2354	Reception - very good. Pool - very good. Kid's area - needs maintenance. Room - very good. Bedsheets was torn. Bathroom - no soap holder. No mug/bucket. Water outlet was bad leading to water stagnant was kind of stinky at time. Open buffet - worst resort buffet ever. Restaurant - Very slow in service. No proper guidance/boards for direction.
ID-2355	All Thing good ....., ........ ........... .. . . .. .... . . .. ....... ...................... ....... . .. . ........................... ........... . .. .. ...............................,.......,.....................................................
ID-2356	Staff were helpful. Greenery everywhere. Rooms are spacious. Beds were old..sinking inside. Got us back pain. No kids swimmimg pool...existing one had lot of tiny insects...buggy was under repair..if you have elderly, they need to walk..needs more maintenance overall. Location is good...beach is accessible...
ID-2357	The hotel is in extreme poor condition. No AC working, Unclean rooms, crumbling bed. Will neither stay again nor recommend to others
ID-2358	Very good
ID-2359	Noisy, difficult to find location, heater not working, overpriced
ID-2360	Breakfast was ordinary idli wada sambhar. There was no choice of fruit or other healthier options
ID-2361	I arrived after 2:00am due to a late flight so was grateful the staff got up to check me in. I was mainly interested in getting some sleep and was able to so. Received a modest breakfast brought to my room. Room was small, but clean and the bed was comfortable.
ID-2362	Please ensure that you provide complete hotel address along with the landmark, surrounding roads etc
ID-2363	Not to go with the net photograph. Rooms are toilet size. Cost is high compare to the facilities.
ID-2364	It's good decent hotel. Not like a top hotels but great for the price.
ID-2365	Not a very good location, only advantage is it is close to airport. Very small room and very noisy. Did not provide shuttle service as promised
ID-2366	Close to the airport but not very clean to my standards. Had to ask for a different room which was cleaner than the previous. But if I did not need to crash for few hrs until my 2am flight, I'd just leave the place and look for something else. Seems popular with local travellers and you can hear everything in your room (someone turns on their TV, ...). Not the best choice!
ID-2367	"It was easy to get to the airport at 2am, which may have been the only upside.

The hotel was very loud all night long and after I woke to someone playing with the doorknob I found myself unable to sleep again."
ID-2368	Good & value for money on that area. They are more flexible with timings. Their service is also good. Hotel contains bar, restaurant.. All are good. They can give even rooms near to lift for families stay.
ID-2369	Geezer and AC does not work. Wi fi is good. Staff behaviour is careless. Warmth in behaviour is missing
ID-2370	The suite room was having bad odour. Except for that the location, facilities are good. Very friendly front office staff. The morning breakfast is worth the pay and will cost 111 rs (if not part of package). Room service is fine. Final say- Short stay, good option.
ID-2371	An excellent hotel, centrally located in Chennai. Neat and clean, rooms good sized and well-done. Staff is courteous and good. Lobby could be little bigger. Check in and check out was smooth. I would recommend this hotel to others and also will stay again.
ID-2372	Good place to stay and decent environment. Center place and it was very close to office. Food is good and also complimentary breakfast is excellent. Need to add more channels on TV. Particularly Kannada is not there.
ID-2373	They don't give importance to online bookings. Room is OK.
ID-2374	The hotels rooms (Other than Suit Rooms) are very small in size and to me was not satisfactory. Suit rooms are OK in standard. The complimentary breakfast served is not quality, but other paid food quality is good. The staff are friendly and helpful.
ID-2375	It's a good and clean hotel with great hospitality and convenient location, I recommend this hotel. It is value for money. In terms of improvement, they can add traditional South Indian breakfast items on their breakfast buffet menu other than only Idly and Dosa.
ID-2376	It's not worth the money I paid for an AC SUITE room which doesn't look like one. Food was not good. The rooms are old and not tidy. Please try to improve your room service quality. I will not recommend this hotel for this tariff.
ID-2377	The location can be a little confusing but not so difficult to find, if you have Google Maps. The hotel staff was courteous and also provided all the basic necessities on time and even without the need for me to ask. Fast wifi, excellent AC, no noise from the outside or the rest of the rooms. Lift facility. Breakfast is complementary and there is an eating joint right next to the hotel.
ID-2378	The place is quiet, calm and is well maintained. It gives a different feel once you reach the place. The reception at the place was quite impressive and there were no negatives to be pointed out. The breakfast provided was really awesome and enjoyed it.
ID-2379	Ambience, facilities may be as per the rent charged. Suitable for families within this budget but general ambience was below than expected, most probably due to A class city and affordable room rent. In the view of economy facilities might be appropriate and hotel is recommended for stay of families within this budget.
ID-2380	Locality is very good, nearby you have Saravana Bhavan Hotel, few mins walk to Kodambakkam station, ATM, Medical shops, Mosque, Church and Temple are just in walkable distance. Very close to Kodambakkam flyover. Please be cautious to close the glass windows, as windows doesn't have metal cross bars. The glass doors can be opened both from inside and outside as well. Food Just OK, otherwise you will enjoy your stay.
ID-2381	Hotel wise nice and located near to main road. Hotel was old, but maintained very well, so clean and staff are very nice. Room service was outstanding. If I will go Chennai, I would like to stay there only.
ID-2382	It was good. Food was OK. Location is much convenient. ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
ID-2383	The room felt like a dungeon and had odd smell. It didn't feel like a suit. staff were not friendly. sheets were not clean.
ID-2384	Our family went through an unexpected family crisis while at Perfect Haven.  The whole staff bent over backwards to help us out.  They were there any time we needed things and provided excellent service.
ID-2385	MORNING BREAKFAST FROM ARIYAS HOTEL.ONLY ONE ITEM PER HEAD.PAID ABOUT 9500 FOR TWO DOUBLE BED ROOM.NOT UPTO MY EXPECTATION.AND STRUGGLED FOR SEARCHING ROOM.NOT ACTUALLY IN OMR MAIN ROAD.IT IS ADJACENT TO THE ROAD.IT IS SITUATED IN STREET AND OPPOSITE THERE IS FACTORY.WORKING VERY NOISE.
ID-2386	noise from a factory across the street. Villas are not secured, and kept open all day into late night. Bathroom mirror worn out 50%. Google maps shows entirely different location, half a kilo meters south. Phones are not reachable, and hotels.com also tried to reach them but in vain. Checkin checkout times are not posted in hotels.com which makes it difficult to decide on a hotel of our choice. Bathroom shower appliances are dirty
ID-2387	This hotel is quite nice. The staff is very friendly and very accommodating. If you are out late, or coming in very early with luggage they will immediately be there to carry your bags to your room. The meals were very good as well. And the hotel is nearby to many small shops that should you run out of something, you can walk around the corner to get it. Coming from the US, it was nice to have the AC and two fans in each room as well.
ID-2388	it was good
ID-2389	not very good as hotels .com give 3 star rating to this hotel
ID-2390	The location was good with a number of good restaurants nearby. The hotel was comfortable for stay and AC was very effective, the staff had been courteous and helpful. The breakfast was complimentary and above average. This is second time that I chose to stay in this hotel. Recommended.
ID-2391	This hotel located very nearby Egmore railway station and good restaurant available nearby hotel, break fast is good, hotel staffs are very co-operative, best thing is this hotel provide 24 hours check out time for online booking customer.
ID-2392	It was overall an good experience to stay at Hotel Victoria. The location was good and exactly Chennai Egmore rly station. The reception staff was good. The housekeeping staff was also cooperative and helpful. The room service was good enough and the breakfast though limited choice was really good and of good standard.
ID-2393	Nice
ID-2394	Ac was not working I make complaint about 7 times after talking with make my trip executive then they at 2. 30 am change the room afterward's no extra bed was given for child complementary breakfast was hopeless all the day idli nd wada with utpam no other types of breakfast is there 3rd day my flight was at 6 am no substitute no parcel breakfast facility is there Total hopeless service no value for money
ID-2395	Very Nice to stay here. It gives pleasant and very calm feel to you. Here WiFi network is awesome and any one can give it best hotel among all available in this price. It also gives you a very happy environment and breakfast.
ID-2396	Had a one day stay at the hotel. Location was very good, easily accessible. Best part was that a Veg Restaurant Saravana Bhavan was just opp the hotel. I recommend this hotel to all business travellers
ID-2397	Good location clean room but poor hospitality but I think this is better option compare prices of other hotel's because location is too good near egmore railway station Chennai and make my trip reduced the rent just half so make my trip.
ID-2398	The hotel location was good. Railway station was nearby the hotel. The appearance of the hotel was good. The service was not good. I didn't take food from the hotel.
ID-2399	Staying there for business purposes is OK since it's near to egmore station. Also food option outside is really good. Staff were cordial. Food in the hotel was a bit expensive so better to try outside. In breakfast not more options were there. Overall it was a nice stay.
ID-2400	It's in a good location. But no value for the money what we paid. Very limited in buffet break fast. Hot water available only in morning time.
ID-2401	Front office were very good. Rooms are neat and only AC control is not good. Staff were very polite and good hospitality. Room size is very good. Overall, good stay in Chennai. It's centrally located, it's easy to shopping and local trains and also easy to reach all the part in Chennai.
ID-2402	Very good hotel. Staff are also very good. Room service and food is excellent. It's near Egmore station, it has centralised Air-Condition with good facility. Daily room cleaning. Cable television. It has a free Wi-Fi connection.
ID-2403	Don't have food options. Bathroom is very small. Rooms not maintain. Only 3 options in breakfast. TV not working. Internet automatically stop working in morning. Except location I didn't found anything good. Doors locke were broken. Toilet sheet was also broken.
ID-2404	The location is convenient for travel to anywhere in the city. The front office staff and the support staff are very cooperative. All in all, a very good value for money choice. Check-in and check-out are flexible. Very close to Egmore Railway station.
ID-2405	Hotel was good. However, kitchen get closed at 11 p.m. So,when I requested for some food for dinner at 11p.m, they refused.
ID-2406	I have mixed reactions for this place.. I like the hotel but felt is is over priced. Conveniently located but in a crowded area.. Clean hotel but not so clean surroundings.. At this price point you could get better options in the vicinity if the station, good eating joints (specially Sarvana Bhavan for their southern fare and Annapurna for authentic Bengali cuisine) and to get a feel of Chennai's underbelly then it makes sense to stay here.
ID-2407	Delightful stay. Staff very friendly. Lobby was great and rooms clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet featured Indian dishes but there were omlettes cooked to order too.
ID-2408	Check in experience is very disappointing as only one staff at the reception and customers are kept waiting for the check in / payment and check out
ID-2409	Please don't suggest to anybody.
ID-2410	it wasn't too bad. but they have annoying wifi daily pass. Hot water wasn't available after 12am till morning.
ID-2411	The property was very nice with ol the facilities.. Food was awesome. Cleanliness was good. The staff and the hotel locality was excellent. Travel facilities was convenient.. Some problem were there due to language not an issue. Overall it was good.
ID-2412	It was just an Ok-Ok place to stay. I stayed there merely because my work place was bang opposite. Poor Service. Poor front office staff. Breakfast buffet was just OK. Nothing great about the hotel. Its an Old hotel. But neat. Good Toilets. Super slow elevator.
ID-2413	Nice stay, enjoyed one day visit, good breakfast was nice but less north Indian options, service OK but needs improvement, good hotel for business purpose, rooms are OK but needs slight renovation. But good trip.
ID-2414	The business club room which I stayed had all the amenities except for a non functional fridge. The room is smaller for all the amenities that is kept. The parking space is smaller. Thanks to the wallet parking there was no hassle, but definitely not owner friendly parking
ID-2415	It was a awesome hotel with nice interior & exterior along with artefacts of ancient time. Nice decorated lift. Very cleaned. Good services. Room has other facility like Bath tub, oven, & fridge. Will visit again if planned.
ID-2416	The hotel location is good! Food served was cold and pathetic! Staff response is very bad. Food served in the buffet was so bad that we could it eat. Even the soup was cold. I felt I wasted 800 rs for such kind of food. This is not the Ambica Hotel that once it used to be. Would recommend all to think twice before booking room in this hotel.
ID-2417	Compared to other hotels it's little bit to develop. We are looking for Low Price and all major Facilities in the Hotel. Food Concept is very worst compared to Residency, Accord, etc. Give some offer every month to attract the customers. Thanks.
ID-2418	Good I would like to stay next time also. I will suggest my and my company people to stay in this hotel. Good rooms. Nice breakfast. Good services by housekeeping and others and front office. Overall good.
ID-2419	The hotel is liked a ghost house. No ventilation and the AC isn't working they are old. Hotel not renovated except pasted a few laminate sheets and the food is bad. I have check out of the hotel just in a hour and moved to Park hotel in same place.
ID-2420	Very good hotel with nice ambiance and very good service... Food is very good... Rooms and serivce up to the mark.... Location is also good with all major nearby proximity... I will recommend this for all traveller... This is a good hotel for couple as well as single business traveller...
ID-2421	Good location but average food. Hotel should improve the quality of the food for the amount they are charging. From food perspective, is not value for money hotel. Apart from the food, it is a good hotel to stay.
ID-2422	I have booked this hotel during my travel to Chennai. Hotel looks quite and seriously need a revamp. In-room service was bad, with pathetic food making the experience worst. I will never opt for this hotel any more.
ID-2423	Good location. Near to metro station .. Forum mall .. Sarwana bhawan .. Murgan idli shop. Room size is good but food quality is just OK but not a wow thing.
ID-2424	Even though it has advantage of location, ambience and infrastructure it is lacking services required. I have to wait for more than fifteen minutes to check in. AC and TV of the room not working after requesting for three four time they shifted to another room after almost an hour. They needs to improve on services rest everything is good.
ID-2425	Customer specific service is the key to the staff. Breakfast spread was very wide and good. Staff was responsive. Smallest of needs were considered and issues fixed to satisfaction.
ID-2426	"wifi was not working.
Food qlty is not so good. i have become sick after eating it."
ID-2427	Air Conditioner not working, inspite of complaining about it staff did nothing to ensure I had a comfortable sleep at night. Pathetic service.
ID-2428	Overall it was good. The reception staff could be more accomodating
ID-2429	Fresh paint stink on the floor and in the room. Poorly made bed. No exhaust in the toilet. Toilet door did not close well and had a big gap which let the stink come into the room.
ID-2430	"Stayed 1 night at hotel as we were in transition. Would not stay longer.
Breakfast staff could be a little friendlier and accommodating."
ID-2431	"Communication barrier
Availability of TV channels (only Tamil channels available)
Incorrect bill presentation
Quality of food is way below basic standards."
ID-2432	I totally loved my stay here. Very good and clean rooms. Very friendly staff who speak Hindi. Reasonable price. Located on the main road and easy access to all places from here. Will recommend and stay here again during my next visit. Cheers :)
ID-2433	Though location of the hotel is not a posh area but it is on the main road and well connected. It's budget hotel, however good food, excellent service and always ready to help staff. I need to mention this particularly. I had to catch a morning flight. They serve breakfast post 7:30am but for me the arranged it at 7:00am. Effort well appreciated.
ID-2434	Nothing boutique about it. Pls do not believe on pictures ..................................... ...................................................................::.......:.:.::.......................... .......................................,,,................................................................
ID-2435	The stay was very good .....the hotel had a good location....very easy to reach over there it had a pleasent appearance..the behaviour of d people over there were very polite...the service was in time.....the food was very good...the rooms were well maintained spacious and clean
ID-2436	The stay was good and the hotel service was pretty satisfying. The food didn't taste that good though. And they could do more better regarding the food, rest all is really fine. I would stay at this place again if I'm in Chennai ever. So, I would conclude saying that the hotel is good
ID-2437	Great experience, especially helpful staff. The person at reception, Peter was really helpful and was flexible about timing in view of my exam tomorrow. Would recommend to anyone in view of value for money, location, good room and prompt service. In case you are a test taker at pro metric then this is the place for you to stay. Just across the street I took just 5 min to reach the center from here.
ID-2438	I have stayed at Hotel Brownstar on two occasions and will prefer it for the third time as well. Good hospitality, good food, good complimentary breakfast. Rooms are very neet and clean, linens are also very good. All Facilities surrounded by hotel and the place is very calm for a pleasant stay.
ID-2439	Brownstar Hotel is good staying in Chennai because it is placed middle of the Chennai city and atmosphere of the brown star hotel is best. The food is also hygienic, and the room service was very good. The Brownstar Hotel room has fully air conditioning rooms. Overall a good to stay here.
ID-2440	Excellent service by the staff. The rooms and bathrooms are exactly what you want. One thing that I definitely have to mention is the care they've taken in preparation of the food, the service and the quality. It is top notch. There were a lot of varieties available. If you visit Chennai, stay at this hotel and you will not be disappointed.
ID-2441	I stayed in this hotel with my company colleges on a 3 day visit to Chennai. Hotel is centrally located and It was a pleasant experience staying there. We all loved the hotel. The service is quick and your requests are attended promptly. The staff is very friendly.
ID-2442	We stayed at this hotel for a day during January. It is centrally located and having clean rooms and other amenities. It is a very good choice for business travellers. Food is ultimate. Staff are humble and service is good. Overall, a nice stay in Chennai.
ID-2443	We went to Chennai to attend a birthday function of my friend's kid. The hotel is so nice and the arrangements were completely owned by the hotel. They made the food tasty and also several fun activities for kids were arranged. Kids will love this hotel.
ID-2444	stayed there for a meeting at the centinal square which is just across the street...very convinient!
ID-2445	Good place to stay and within budget. Food is good especially the dosas. A must have. Rooms are good and well equipped. Staff was well behaved and cordial and ready to help. Food varieties were not much which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise a good place to stay in within budget.
ID-2446	it is a very good hotel and staying is very nice .food good.rooms are good and it is probably the best one in chennai.it is on the center of the city . its appearance is very breautiful ..............................................................
ID-2447	The hotel is ok if you have a lot of work and just return for the night. Accomodations are basic.
ID-2448	I had visited this hotel for official purpose. The hotel was located inside the city. The Wi-Fi facility was available in the hotel. The coffee maker was available in the rom. The food quality was nice in the hotel. The food was not value for money.
ID-2449	The staff are courteous, efficient and helpful. Amazing food and a wide variety of choices during breakfast. The only drawback is that the hotel is a little far off from the city centre but that can also work in your favour if a bit of quiet is your aim. The distance is worth it considering the comfortable stay.
ID-2450	I had visited this hotel for official trip. The appearance of the hotel was nice. Basic facility was provided in the room. All kind of food was provided. In the hotel activity was available.
ID-2451	Excellent hospitality. Professional staff. Easy check in and check out facility. Rooms were neatly maintained. Overall experience was awesome and would definitely recommend to people visiting Chennai.
ID-2452	Room service totally unsatisfactory, you can say worst, rest everything was normal. I stayed first time in this hotel with one of my professional. I love to stay in fortune pandiyan Madurai. Nirmal Goyal
ID-2453	Customer service is very bad, specially in the restaurant. I really don't recommend to stay. Indeed very bad experience. Reception argued to have a passport citing address proof. They did not accept a driver's license. Restaurant quality is very bad.
ID-2454	Fortune Select Palms is located in Thoraipakkam in the OMR road in Chennai IT corridor. A very decent hotel in nice locality. The Hotel is located very much on the IT highway. The hotel can be easily accessed through public transport as well. The rooms are neat and clean. Don't forget to ask the road side view rooms for better view.
ID-2455	It was very nice movement for staying at this hotel, the hotel was very nice as well the management, they received very well. After that we had great dinner and it was very nice food. The room was very neatly maintained and the atmosphere also very nice in the room. It was very nice experience.
ID-2456	Good hotel. Nice food especially. Courteous staff.
ID-2457	Spent one night at this hotel during a business travel. The room was large, very well equipped and clean. The package came with complimentary WiFi @ 512kbps. The buffet spread for both dinner and breakfast were quite elaborate with options satisfying every palette. I felt the service could have been a little more attentive. Overall this is a very good hotel for any business traveler to Chennai with work in the OMR vicinity.
ID-2458	"I would say the best healthy breakfast I ever had and the GYM is also quite great.
Great Service and folks at reception desk were very nice and helpful"
ID-2459	 polite staff
ID-2460	This is the best hotel for me because its food and room is good and location is also good in night time.
ID-2461	 awesome food and service
ID-2462	Had been visited here with friends for weekend chillout. Food at hotel is so tasty and delicious especially we loved the South Indian food. Rooms are little small but clean and nice. Pool is smaller one, we enjoyed in pool for around 2 hours. Service staff are excellent in their job. Overall we enjoyed the sunday.
ID-2463	"Website shows it to be a member ITC group hotel but they do not participate so one does not get any reward point on the ITC club membership. Overpriced.

Poor service. Requested for duvet cover instead of the thick blanket, got none.
No iron in the room. Request for amenities like conditioner, loofah went unattended."
ID-2464	even though this was just a business trip, i really had a fantastic time as the hotel staff is extremely kind and courteous. they went out of the way to make our breakfasts and dinners memorable and were always there to help out for local travel advise.
ID-2465	Very nice and well maintained. Break fast was worthy. Slight improvement needed in bath Toilet.
ID-2466	The location was good as it was in front of our conference venue. But services were not satisfactory for value of money. Air conditioner was noisy could not even sleep at night. Even after complaining it was not repaired till we checked out. I was not satisfied with the services.
ID-2467	Its a small hotel with clean room, easily accessible to Chennai Trade center. Though rooms are not spacious but what else we can get for a small price very near to Chennai trade centre?. Front office staff was supportive and very quick responsive. Suitable for business stay and also for a visit for trade fairs. Overall its a small hotel with good facilities.
ID-2468	Good and cosy experience. Though the room was quite small. It was a drop by kind of a stay as I was visiting an exhibition just opposite the place where the hotel is located. A small but, clean corridor lead to the rooms. Bathroom was quite oldish, but to mention was at least clean for a quick freshen up as required.
ID-2469	I stayed here for 3 days. The hotel has amazing hospitality to provide to it's customers. I was really satisfied with the services of this hotel. The rooms were clean and well kept. The bathroom was nice and with proper sanitation facility. The hotel has nice and clean front office. The atmosphere was peaceful. The hotel has nice location and good appearance.
ID-2470	We went to Chennai for sightseeing with our family and stayed in Akash Inn as already my friend visited and stayed there. I was satisfied with the services provided. We had a very good time and the activities planned by the hotel staff were excellent. The food was really good, hygiene.
ID-2471	hotel is very good location, food & drink service is also average as compare any hotel near by. hospitality of hotel an average. transport connection also nearly attached. hotel environment is very safe. people working in hotel having nice attitude & co operative. parking facility of hotel also an average.
ID-2472	Akash Inn one of the best place in Chennai. So many of people like this hotel only. All facilities are available in this hotel. Foods are of very good taste. It's a good place to take a break or crash is your in town for a short visit, and you need a place that won't tear your pocket for the stay and you've come to enjoy the city life this is the place.
ID-2473	It's a good place to take a break or crash in, for a short stay. The hotel provides with all necessary facilities. Food is very good. The services are quite good. The weather is very pleasant and soothing.

ID-2475	this hotel is very good rooms are always so good receptionist are speak gently to me morning breakfast is also so good i like very much. water, wifi this are all so nice i staying this hotel i will enjoy fully hotel restaurant is also nice eeeeeeeeeeeee
ID-2476	It's a good place to take a break or crash, is your in town for a short visit, and you need a place that won't tear your pocket for the stay and you've come to enjoy the city life this is the place for you. If youâ€™re travelling light and especially single good location and it's in proximity to good malls and food outlets and other fun stuff.
ID-2477	 good location
ID-2478	In my recent visit to my home town I was searching for nearby restaurant for home delivery, I found this ordered egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, naan and chicken kassa. The real problem was delivery, after many followup they delivered 1 hr 30 late though they said it would take only 20min good part was food tasted good Food 3.5/5 Service 2/5 VFM 4/5
ID-2479	I stayed there for three days. It is located in the city. Hotel location is good. Look wise, it is average. I went there for business purpose. Food was okay. Rooms were good. Services were satisfactory. Chennai is a beautiful place for visitors. I went there in January. WIFI facility was there. Food was below average. Fridge was not available in the room but AC and TV facilities were there.
ID-2480	Food was a disappointment, so also cleanliness of bathroom.
ID-2481	Fantastic experience 5 star rating. Location is good, but quality wise up to the mark... Traffic is high. Hotel location is good Travel facility and breakfast is very good. Staff cooperative. Nice ambience.
ID-2482	Location is good, but quality wise not up to the mark... Traffic is high. But hotel location is good. Travel facility and breakfast is very good. Staff cooperative. I will recommend to stay but price wise high.
ID-2483	The location of the Hotel is very good. Ideal from the airport. The ambience and the reception lobby is very attractive. The people are also very friendly and helpful. The room was excellent followed by commendable service. The food offered during the breakfast was found to be very good apart from the hygiene. Overall the feeling during the stay was very good.
ID-2484	Decent 3 star hotel at the heart of the city.. Location is superb.. Food is OK.. Standard rooms are small.. Cleanliness is also decent.. Overall, a very good budget hotel with prices being very reasonable.
ID-2485	Clean and neat rooms. Very comfortable stay. The reception was helpful and they provided extra care. Only found that their emergency exit through stairs needs to maintained and cleaned. Overall a decent place in this locality.
ID-2486	I had an amazing stay at the hotel, its best for Business travellers. Wehcbwec wciwelbc cifbiuweef
ID-2487	Nice & quiet place and still pretty much close to everything. Good friendly staff and neat rooms. Few modern luxuries missing - Kettle on the room, only 1 plug point - but not a spoiler. Decent breakfast. Will probably prefer to stay again. All this feels worth when the room costs Rs. 3000 after discounts from MMT. Best available rates at hotel seem to be higher.
ID-2488	The neat mid sized business hotel in a quiet residential area in Kilpauk. It is not attached to any chain or group the staff are OK. Breakfast was less than breakfast was not good though. There was no kettle or a tea/coffee sachets the were not complimentary for standard rooms was told. But if you're looking for a neat place and comfortable. Yes!
ID-2489	It's OK night officer guiding thought highest thought Highgate bigger things Chung chugging Chichester woman children Chicago guiding Chinese biggest builder Vikings things changed my insurance changed things la ago solamnu Susannah disk Susan suggestion
ID-2490	The hotel is kept clean. Staff are OK. Breakfast was less than ordinary. Hotel is located in kilpauk where it is difficult to find a nice hotel. The tariff was on a higher side. With the deal code it's useful.
ID-2491	Nice location, very peaceful stay. Neat, rooms good and service but wi-fi had to be activated every time. We needed to use breakfast was also good. On the whole we had a good stay but the buffet dinner at night could have been better with a little more verity.
ID-2492	Wi-fi not provided even after request. Sometimes in this hotel wi-fi will not works properly and the food was not so good, there is no South Indian food available and we can depend only on North Indian or other food.
ID-2493	The hotel is a fabulous property. All the services and amenities are quite proper. People are warm well coming. Overall a perfect blend of all the amenities Perfect for Business travel. Value for money. Food was Excellent. Nice amenities and comfortable check in and check out. Hotel is very clean.
ID-2494	First all staff were courteous and helpful. The check in process was smooth and efficient. Room service and house keeping was excellent. A few suggestions are that the hotel is aging and they could do with renovating the bath rooms.
ID-2495	Not as fancy as the name sounds, just value for money. Do not expect anything fancy,very basic rooms and not so great buffet breakfast.
ID-2496	excellent
ID-2497	I have been Chennei six times,this is the best hotel I have come across.Very friendly staff,helpful and make your stay very comfortable.Food is fine and service is good .The whole hotel is extremely clean and tidy at the very reasonable price for travelers .
ID-2498	for a 3 star, the hotel is good, but there is lot of scope for improvement.
ID-2499	OK hotel, quality and comfort of bed is horrible, can feel the spring below the bed.  Price paid through this website is too much for this type of hotels in Chennai.  Price could have been in par with other 3 stars hotel in Chennai city.
ID-2500	Puzzled to understand why the Hotel has chosen this Model. Puzzled to understand why the Hotel has chosen this Model. Guzzled to understand why the Hotel has chosen this Model.
ID-2501	I had the opportunity to stay at Katti-Ma for one night. One of the best hotel in Chennai. Friendly people around and available all the time for quick service. Buffet had lots of choices and it was yum. The room were clean and had all the basic amenities.
ID-2502	The hotel is good and value for money. The room was clean. AC, Wi-fi, TV and mini refrigerator were working properly. Food was also good. The hotel is also having gym facility. The staff was also very cooperative. Getting taxi on time is a bit difficult due to high traffic nearby.
ID-2503	The AC was not working well and after my repeated calling to the service desk they sent an mechanic to fix the issue after 20 mins. Then I would say the door locks are poor as even time in get in to my room I need to call the executive to bring a new card as the locker was not working well.
ID-2504	Location, pleasantness of the staff, cleanliness of room, quite AC and hot shower was available at all times are the plus of this hotel. Morning breakfast buffet was really good with instant and cordial service by the staff. Hotel bar service was really good and it's a value for money.
ID-2505	Location and hospitality of the hotel is good. This time AC worked perfectly in my room. Even though I have checked in very late but I am not able to extend my check-out time for half an hour. And also, breakfast was not good.
ID-2506	Well maintained. Good location... Buffet breakfast had a good spread. I would say it's a value for money deal. Options for dinner are also good. They have some options on the menu which are like home cooked food. Overall a 10 on 10.
ID-2507	Good one for staying. C
ID-2508	Nice to stay. Value for money. Good room service. Iwill ssuggest
ID-2509	Service is very slow, issues with toilet, booked a smoking room whereas they said there are no smoking rooms. Breakfast listed in menu but didn't deliver in the room. Staff comes and knocks every now and then for room cleaning. Asked for wake up call didn't get any. Don't try their biryani you will burn your tongue out.
ID-2510	Stay was good .. Clean room friendly staff .. Only thing to consider is if booking for double then amenities should be for two. Buffet is quite spread one .. Nice bar to experience .. Would surely visit again ...
ID-2511	Hotel was good. Room was convenient. Healthy breakfast provided especially mint dipped water. Neat ambience. Well behaved staff members. Room was spacious. Easy access to main centres. Located in residential area and the area was good. Overall good
ID-2512	It was all good front office deal n apperance and staff apperancewas also good, food, service and all was good. it was feeling like littel hot in waiting lobby otherwise all was good. Thanks.....
ID-2513	The rooms were bit to cramped, in room dining experience too was not good and the food served was over priced. I did not find it a value for money and would not recommend anyone for a stay in KEYS. I got attracted by the Brand "KEYS" and my experience was a let down.
ID-2514	Stay was fine. Can improve on food. Adgghhhhhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjkkllkjhhhhjjhjjjjjjjjjjjjjhhbbhjjjjj+jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjnnnnjjhggfgjjhgghhhhhhggghhggghhvgffgghhhhhgggggggggggggggg
ID-2515	"Clean rooms, non intrusive staff, good breakfast.
Good value for money."
ID-2516	Worst hotel! There was no room after the payment was made and confirmed and made us to wait for more than 3 hours to make a alternative! And this is not the 1st time by Key's... we are facing the same issue for 2nd time.
ID-2517	This nice little hotel is very close to Adyar, Thiruvanmiyur and the IT highway. The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms clean. Wifi was patchy in my room but not in my friend's, so it varies. The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. I'll stay there again.
ID-2518	The Hotel is close to the airport and has quick access if your work takes you to OMR road and vicinity. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. Do not expect to flag a auto from outside the hotel as the hotel is tucked away on the street. Thankfully Radio cabs can be easily booked and the hotel is easily located by the drivers.
ID-2519	I stayed for 3 weeks and was happily surprised by the service and eagerness to help of all the staff at Keys Katti Ma. The rooms are quite spacious and cleaned daily. The restaurant was good quality and reasonably priced with a buffet dinner on Thursday night that is very good.  The buffet breakfast is as good as the ones in some (supposedly) 5 star places. As a female traveller I found the experience quite safe, comfortable and home like.
ID-2520	This is essentially a budget hotel, however, the staff are friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that having specifically requested a non-smoking room, our room smelt very strongly of cigarettes, so we only spent one night there and decided to move on.
ID-2521	Wonderful staff, you can't beat this place for the price/
ID-2522	This hotel is good but basic accommodation. There are lots of good restaurants nearby, even on the same lane. Breakfast was basic Indian fare and toast, sometimes a hard boiled egg. They will give you one internet sign-in per person per day, which can be a headache if you have multiple devices. There is a very small gym with a treadmill, exercise bike and a hodgepodge of small dumbbells.
ID-2523	Not so great.  But it is still acceptable. Bit high for money wise.
ID-2524	Nice people and friendly staff. Lot of mosquito's in room and bathroom full of bugs.
ID-2525	Although I took single non AC room. It was not so comfortable. Bed was very compact. The room was clean and bathroom very hygiene. For value of money I can say it was satisfactory. There was nothing much to do with room service. The best part was even with such cheap rate room they have provided the breakfast. As breakfast was so.. Any how in such rate what you want more than that.
ID-2526	I like the environment and service Is also good. Staff behaviour is also fine But the food quality is not clean .. We found cockroch in Breakfast .. My Suggestion is don't eat foor inside restaurant.
ID-2527	Good had no issues while staying. Couldn't book the hotel next day for stay. Reception was very arrogant people. Good was costly. A single Pepsi cost around Rs 70. Cleaning of hotel room was good. Good altogether.
ID-2528	It is a good experience and the location is convenient for all works. People are very cordial. Rooms are neatly maintained. They helped me in even getting auto and in getting other information regarding my works. The hotel is found secured. Can stay with family.
ID-2529	Hotel Pandian is at an average location but nearby Egmore station so a good point to choose this hotel. Rooms are good and clean. Nearby area is ok, lots of option available around this hotel for food restaurant joints, having food at the hotel restaurant is a heavy cost to our pockets due to 20% tax payable on each food item.
ID-2530	Good value for money with very proactive staff. The location again excellent, just opposite to the Egmore railway station. The newly renovated bar is sexy and is very generous in offering snacks along with drinks. Overall, a good experience...
ID-2531	This place was a total value for money. A good breakfast buffet with some really friendly staff. The rooms were pretty clean too! Being right in the heart of the city it was closer to most of the city's attraction and transportation was easy.
ID-2532	Hotel location is really nice. All the public transport facilities are easily accessible from the hotel. Rooms were small but clean. However drawback is refrigerator is not provided in room. Food quality was good but still can be improved. Staff doesn't know other than local language so it is pathetic.
ID-2533	Breakfast was quite good. Restaurant Serves, ambience needs improvement. Linen was clean but stained. AC was not up to the mark. Advantage is all parts of Chennai are accessible by suburban trains buses autos taxis etc. From here.
ID-2534	I have booked this hotel for 3 days whereas immediately after check-in in the hotel on first day, then immediately I came out from the hotel. I did not stay back there. After coming from the hotel, I have again booked another hotel.
ID-2535	This hotel Location. Near by Egmore Railway station. So easy to access Travel for OLA. And Uber. And also train BAR. And Restaurant. Morning complimentary Break Fast. So Facilities OK. So value for money.
ID-2536	I often do travel many places in and around Andhra Pradesh/ Telangana/ Tamil Nadu. On 15th July I had a meeting in my Chennai branch office. Booked an executive non AC room / service was ok. Room was idle to stay good ventilation and the breakfast was average.
ID-2537	Good hotel. Nice stay clean rooms. Friendly staff. Five star rating to be given. Although the breakfast was served, quality not up to the mark. However Good restaurants are nearby available to meet our requirements.
ID-2538	The staff were very helpful & flexible, location is good, breakfast variety could have been better. Overall had a good experience. Receptionist was flexible with check-in and check out time. Staff was cooperative as well. The best part is that it is located near the railway station.
ID-2539	Good budget hotel. Very close to railway station. Cleanliness is good. For business people for hospital going people its very good. Air condition is good. Room service not bad. Front desk is brilliant. Simply saying neat stay.
ID-2540	Breakfast was Indian buffet style. Difficult to get simple black coffee and omelette. Restaurant manager not very pleasant or accommodating. Could do with a few lessons from bar staff who were great.
ID-2541	It is worth of money would recommend to every one I know Breakfast was good very Rooms were little small
ID-2542	I booked a king bed for my parents but when they arrived we got only standard double bed.Even after showing the booking confirmation the staff resisted on giving the king bed.
ID-2543	As you see the View of the hotel it is totally reverse, Breakfast is not at all good and overall feeling is not great, very small hotel.
ID-2544	The guy in the reception is pain in the neck and he was not helpful at all everything else is ok.
ID-2545	The staff at the reception was not friendly. This was a good hotel long time ago and the service and quality has drastically changed lately.
ID-2546	"Since I am a train frnatic - - being close to Egmore Station was a plus - - - I spent many hours
at the station - - enjoying trains coming and going, and people starting their travels!"
ID-2547	Very unfriendly staff. Toilets are badly designed with no separate bathing area. Staff kept on saying as its a online booking many facilities were not available
ID-2548	Room comfort was ok. Bathroom needs improvement. Free breakfast was terrible. Coffee very bitter. No hair dryer for standard rooms. No toilet paper.
ID-2549	Pleasant Stay
ID-2550	Not a four star
ID-2551	We were pleasantly surprised to find this special hotel in the busy urban environment of Chennai. The staff were extremely attentive, assisting with luggage, answering questions, responding to concerns, etc. The hotel is also located very close to the airport, only about 2 km away, which was convenient in catching my flight out of India in a timely, relaxed manner.
ID-2552	I had a short stay and would rate my experience as average. The dish TV signal was not strong and went off. The free wi-fi was ok. Food in the restaurant was good!
ID-2553	Reached hotel to find it shares a common entrance with a crowded restaurant where you have to carry your luggage through a waiting crowd to reach an elevator. The hotel did not have the Expedia reservation. They apparently had not logged in for a few days. Finally got rooms assigned to find weird bathrooms where shower is not separate. You take a shower, you wet/flood the whole bathroom. This hotel is clearly not for any Western traveler.
ID-2554	Clean, all services provided, comfortable, close to airport.economical and good for the budget conscious family traveller.
ID-2555	Good hotel and good location with 24-hr check-out time but the price is still expensive. The breakfast was good quality. The hotel is newly constructed with new furnishings. But, the room size is very small for any extra bed. The daily rate for the hotel is very high for the facility and size of the room. The rate should be reduced to give better value for the money.
ID-2556	Shower Not functioning.So we are forced to bath with mug and bucket.Hotel staffs are not receptive to our complaints.They have not arranged pickup.They said, airport drop is free but the cab driver demanded Rs.100 extra and for that he argued rudely.So I paid Rs.100 extra to avoid quarrels with the driver.They don't have control over drivers.Rs.3200 for the room is not worth .
ID-2557	Great Hotel! Excellent.. Lives up to the star Rating..2 1/2 star
ID-2558	In transit and wouldn't have spent more time; apart from the free airport shuttle, nothing good to be mentioned. Bed blanket durty, corridor very Noisy, minimum service
ID-2559	As most people do we used this hotel for a 1 night stopover but it was not so nice for us. It is basic which is fine but it was also dirty and noisy. The shower was more of a drip and the staff are very persistent when waiting for their tips! On a postive note they did collect us and drop us at the airport but I would probably rather stay in the airport rather than this hotel.
ID-2560	We needed a hotel to stay in before our 4am flight, instead of hanging out at the airport. This hotel surprised us! they picked us up at the airport free of charge, the staff is very polite and very friendly, the room was very clean. the neighborhood wasn't the best but we were only there for less than 24 hours. We enjoyed our stay!
ID-2561	Not as expected..
ID-2562	It Was A Good Break For A Nap And Shower.
ID-2563	Close ti airport and they arrange for the pickups. It ,s plus point. They could have kept a small piece of bathing soap.
ID-2564	Clear, hotel staff very helpful, location good. Values for money. Overall good stay. USA consulate is just 150 meters away ideally best place to stay if you have any work at USA consulate. Overall satisfied with the stay.
ID-2565	All amenities were provided in the room. I had visited this hotel for official purpose. The hotel was located in the city. The room was neat and clean. The complimentary food was provided in the hotel. I would like to recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers.
ID-2566	A good lodge to stay. Very near to shopping and other commercial area. Staff were courteous. Available of transport to any where anytime. Rooms maintained very well. Cost wise, it is affordable let me wish the lodge all the best. Please keep it up and maintain. Try to visit again and again.
ID-2567	Worth the stay. Really good place and peaceful place to spend your weekend and holidays. Nice atmosphere and the kids will love the pool and the food is not that great. The rooms are clean and the wood work is just so good you don't want to leave this place.
ID-2568	Nice place for leisure... Good location, and peaceful... Kerala model rooms... Nice service.. Foods are bit costly... The rooms are good... Reception service is very good... Swimming pool and other facility are nice...
ID-2569	OK.. Worth the money. Awesome location near beach.. Food was costly.. If you want to have a date, perfect place to be with your loved one. They can do better service and regarding food, we ordered Naan and we got paratha which is silly thing and in bill they mention as Naan.
ID-2570	Good .. Worth the money. Awesome location near beach .. Food was costly .. BAr is excellent .. If you want to have a date, perfect place to be with your loved one ..
ID-2571	It was a pleasant stay. Such a peaceful location within the city. Nice place to hangout with friends. Swimming pool need to be maintained properly that's the only discomfort we felt beside it was a good stay.
ID-2572	The location good. The service good. The room good. Facilities are good Value for money. Cleanliness good. Swimming pool is kind of ok, not great. Restaurants and bar are good. Resort is not too big or too small. If you want to spend one day, it's ok not more than that.
ID-2573	No proper customer service, need improvement in handling customer. Food is average. Ambience is overall good but without customer handling it would waste, being curious to your customer for understanding their needs.
ID-2574	Good and pleasant environment. Feel like to again and again. And the service is very Nice .. We feel like we are in Kerala because of the trees. It's really good place for kids also . . Because play area is good. They are maintain the pool also good .. And the next most important thing is beach is very close to the resort ..
ID-2575	masssssssssssss nbhugtfuvhftytd6fyyfdd7t hjf7f878hioug7rb gvyf8hobuyyf7tb bgytiugyd7 tyd7ggyf7nngh8bn big8bhiguytvdttivyugoubig8ty89biugfvy7uygviub kjvyguf87h ihg89yhbufu8g khihgigytf8bhujc b8yg8biugt67g88u8 bug89t9g8yr8h ngyufuyyyg87guyfgt ygyugiguug
ID-2576	For the price paid, the room was excellent. Room service is very poor, I had to call a couple of times to even reach them on phone. Beach is like 100 mtrs away but it is nice to spend the evening there. The facility is well-maintained. Overall, good rooms at this price. Worth staying.
ID-2577	The guys at the reception and the room service are literally amazing, they are courteous and very helpful. The minus could be the rooms which are old and the time taken to serve food in the restaurant. Really you need patience. They will test your patience.
ID-2578	Compared to VGP Resorts and Maya kajal resorts, green meadows resort is much more worth in quality and price worth of staying within the city limits. But foods are very costly. 24 hours of staying will make sweet memories.
ID-2579	The actual hotel rooms are not as good as it shows in pics/website. Food (though limited options under complimentary breakfast) & the exteriors were good. The chlorine content in swimming pool was extremely high. Overall, the tariffs - rooms & food - are costly and not worth the high price.
ID-2580	The rooms are old and poor. No value for money, all food start at minimum Rs. 200 per dish. Will not taste good. Complementary breakfast very poor. Totally upset after my family trip. I screwed my family happiness because of taking them there. Not happy.
ID-2581	Very good location. Happy to stay there. Room was good, service is good, food is good but slight expensive. Swimming pool is very good. Easy to locate in google map. Deluxe room was very good and had a wonderful stay. Personally I liked the stay in Green Meadows and I will refer to my friends also. Thank you.
ID-2582	Not worth of the money we paid.worst ac.no water.no cleaning of rooms.
ID-2583	"Though the property is good, it's approach road and the neighborhood is awful. If I open my window curtain, the neighborhood building people can peep into my room without any effort.
Not very comfortable to stay with family"
ID-2584	"Room was clean and tidy. Staff were very friendly. 5 minute walk to railway station.
Market and restaurants nearby.
Just 1 minor issue asked for a towel and 2 of the staff didn't understand what I was asking for luckily I had my own for just such an issue."
ID-2585	Nice hotel with very friendly staff. Reasonable location.
ID-2586	The location of the resort is beautiful. It is serene despite being close to high-way, nice walk-ways, and a big size swimming pool than average, and great food, helpful staff. My only suggestion for the hotel would be to improve upon the cleanliness of bathrooms, and get newer fixtures in there.
ID-2587	Stayed at this property for the first time. Very impressive landscape, impeccable rooms, laced the breakfast spread and the courteous staff all the way. Highly recommended. Chalukya restaurant, Chaplin bar, indoor games and conference hall also nice.
ID-2588	Nice people at front office and also located near SEZ so is convenient to travel. Can improve a lot with little bit of more efforts. Overall it was a nice experience. Some improvements in sports room and snooker sticks should at least have tips attached to them. Recommended if you have to travel to SEZ area.
ID-2589	In front office Looks like very simple hotel. Rooms were good but needs to be maintain in periodic condition. Food service and restaurant people behave good mannerism. Swimming pool available. We not used. Many foreigners visiting this hotel. Parking facility separately available. Rooms placed in some distance from main highway. No disturbance or noise from highway.
ID-2590	Buffet breakfast is excellent and room is good, but not so good for a Club Premium room. Children enjoyed in the swimming pool and as there is no Mosquitoes we had a good sleep. Overall nice for one day outing with family. There is a leakage in the tap water, so expecting more cleanliness in the toilet and bedsheets.
ID-2591	Hospitality is lacking. Front desk in-charge wanted to check the online payment (made through Makemytrip). In-fact he does not approve the discount offered to me by Makemytrip initially. Then I made him understand about the deal. This is not the way a customer is treated in any hotel.
ID-2592	Very good location, excellent appearance. Very excellent room, service, front office, food & drinks. Activities and everything is for relaxing stay.
ID-2593	Greatttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
ID-2594	Resort is situated on Bangalore Chennai highway, easily approachable front office people. Food was average. Only problem was that there was no geyser so had to wait for hot water which comes from solar. You need to inform front office people beforehand in order to get hot water early in the morning. Overall it was a good stay.
ID-2595	Last time I stayed in that particular resort, there was good locality and nature. Very good response from reception peoples. Foods are also very good totally am like that place. But rest room maintenance is not good.
ID-2596	There was no delay in check in and checkout. I was happy with the room but not so clean and all amenities were working. The bed sheets and towels were not clean. There was no view from the room. The food was taken from outside. I would not recommend this hotel to others. I was not happy with the money spent. The service quality was very poor and response was also poor.
ID-2597	As title suggests it is a good resort with all amenities eg, swimming pool, indoor games, yoga centre, ayurvedic therapy, good gardens spread all over. Rooms are good in size offering fresh air. Wi-Fi speed is not great but worked ok. Food is fine and overall, good hotel to stay if you want to stay outskirts of Chennai.
ID-2598	Hotel is situated at Sriperumbudur which takes almost 1 hour from Chennai airport. Hotel offers all resort facilities eg. indoor play, swimming pool, etc. One can stay & enjoy. Food quality is good although slightly expensive. WiFi speed is good. Recommended if you are ready to stay outside Chennai.
ID-2599	We stayed there for a while and attended a function in the party hall. Room was clean and the property was well maintained. Their party hall was also pretty decent. Will stay here again if travelling with family. Stayed December 2014, travelled with family
ID-2600	we wood like to say that your hotel is very good like house keeping and room service , maintenance all are like very beautiful, travel are available also very good, WIFI also available, we will plan to come next year also. almost we are very happy to say good our family, Chinese and Japanese food also available and massage also available.
ID-2601	Perfect for people visiting Chennai for seeking treatment at Apollo Main Hospital. Surroundings are very calm and serene. Food quality is excellent
ID-2602	The hotel is located very conveniently with a variety of eateries around. The staff were extremely considerate and well mannered. The rooms were well kept and the staff well groomed. A wonderful experience on the whole.
ID-2603	Feels like you are in a home and it's relaxing. Rooms are comfortable though not luxurious or modern. Pleasant and friendly staff. Food is like home cooked without too many colours and additives. But lunch and dinner has to be ordered a few hours in advance.
ID-2604	Homely feel, secure and lot of care. Staff very friendly, warm and helpful. The location can not termed the best in the City. Don't feel like Outside stay. Food by order is just like out of our home kitchen. Overall Hanu Reddy is home away from home.
ID-2605	Good to stay for a short trip. Awesome location will come back again to stay. Good staff to assist in all forms of support. Will recommend by business associates and friends to stay in Hanu Reddy Poes Garden.
ID-2606	Awesome place and very good staff who takes utmost care with love. The place is very clean and makes you feel very homely. The food is very clean with very less oil. Anyone coming for medical issues can find this place very useful as Apollo Hospital is just stone throw away distance from the place and because of the cleanliness you can prefer this.
ID-2607	Generally good with courteous and helpful staff. However the bathroom sink was cracked. Also the water supply ran out on our penultimate day, though it was restored within half an hour of our complaint. The food cooked to order was simple and excellent as was the included breakfast. Overall, I would rate the place favourably.
ID-2608	I visited Hannu Residency in December 2015. The hotel was a great value for the money and is well connected. The rooms are spacious, clean and have a homely ambience. Great complimentary breakfast, helpful staff and decent room service were the highlights.
ID-2609	We enjoyed our stay at Hanu Reddy Residences Wallace Garden, it was clean and comfortable. Good wifi and excellent food, the area was nice to walk around and we felt safe at night, great complimentary breakfast, and the staff were very helpful and did not charge up on taxis, I would stay there again.
ID-2610	Very good location. Despite its proximity to the busiest part of the city there was barely any noise around. Easy to travel around Chennai from this property. Can't rate the food because I didn't try it. Rooms were spacious and neat and captures the character of the city in its styling.
ID-2611	Excellent service, location and food. Good value for money. We went for medical purpose in Apollo and the hotel is just 2 min walking distance. The hotel is very homely and food is also homely and good in taste. The location is also good. In the evening we got some time an found some decent mall, restaurants are in walk-able distance.
ID-2612	Food is the highlight of this hotel. I would call this place more of a guest house than a hotel. Service is excellent & feels like homely most of the times. Location is quite strategic & very close to the CM's House. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who frequently comes to Chennai.
ID-2613	Hotel is very nice with nice location we visited this hotel by our own vehicle, the hotel is very easy to locate as the hotel is on main road. Appearance of this hotel is awesome and interiors are also cool. Food and drinks are delicious, housekeeping service is also great and helpful. Hotel is in between many trees so the atmosphere is also pleasant.
ID-2614	the whole experience was gud,except for the food.the view was mesmerizing and the room was tidy,overall gud experience.it is in the heart of the town and nearby to the busstand,nonveg wasntWe booked the room before leaving from , chennai but they are not given that room they given normal to us and tell us stay up to evening will shift after that .
ID-2615	Everything goes so Perfect... I don't. Need to recall it. Nice reception nice room nice food and staff also cooperated. But locality not so good. Rest all was perfect. Near station its best at this rate.
ID-2616	The overall experience was very good. The hotel is clean, near the station and market. The breakfast is nice. Staff cooperative. The restaurant serves very good food, only improvement that can be suggested is different kitchens for VEG-Non VEG. The hotel is good for families also.
ID-2617	Stayed here for just 1 night on a work trip to Chennai. The room is big and well done and the service matched the elegance of the hotel. I appreciated them going beyond what could normally be expected.
ID-2618	Very close to railway station. Nice hospitality. Easy to approach shopping malls. Staff very kind. Food was excellent. Complimentary breakfast very good. Next visit prefer to stay in same hotel, nice location. Room maintained well.
ID-2619	Hotel is good. But service has to be improved. Lot of waiting in between order and delivery time. Window view is ugly. Breakfast buffet style is appreciated. Taxi service should be provided in reasonable cost.
ID-2620	The room was clean and the service provided by them was up to the mark but the surrounding area has a lot of beggars sitting nearby which kind of irritates a person. Breakfast is included in the meal. Slippers were not provided by them which must be given by them.
ID-2621	Good experience nice facilities good service. G
ID-2622	I had been there third times. It is good hotel, friendly staff and good value money. I want suggest one thing please serve complimentary breakfast in room if guest is not comfortable there. Actually restaurant has not enough place. Otherwise excellent experience.
ID-2623	Enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Everything was perfect and to my complete satisfaction. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was OK and variety need to be looked at again. Excellent location. Very close to the Chennai central railway station.
ID-2624	Good. Enjoyed the stay and food. Can be reached in minutes from station. Nice reception. The employees were really good and wanting to do the needful. I enjoyed the buffet breakfast. The room was spacious. Thank you MMT.
ID-2625	Excellent Rooms, Excellent Breakfast ... Cooperative Staff ... Can be visited .. In the heart of the city convenient in all aspects
ID-2626	It was a pleasant stay at this hotel as it was close to. Park station where I had to travel by train everyday to Thiruvanmiyur for my course. I had a good time in this hotel and found to be decent in cleanliness and service. Location is the midst important aspect as it was close to the station.
ID-2627	I had stay for 3 days. And I love to stay more. Their service is excellent. Specially their breakfast.. I love it. Its so delicious. Their cleanliness is also superb. I suggest people should stay there.
ID-2628	Very nice to stay over in this hotel ... Clean and good ... Little have to improve room cleaning and rest room facilities ... Atmosphere was good .. Keep it up
ID-2629	Very nice hotel. Had a lively time. Breakfast was nice. All together a very nice pleasant stay. Need to update in Google maps the exact location of the hotel.
ID-2630	Overall stay was nice. However beware of the travel agents who sit in the lobby. They charge you crazy rates for taxis.
ID-2631	There is constant silent music playing in the hallways (My Heart Will Go On from \"Titanic\") and it is pure h3ll for those who do not like Celine Dion. Otherwise it was nice enough hotel. Some rooms do not have windows (or ventilation) and are to be avoided at all costs.
ID-2632	WORST HOTEL EVER.NEVER EVER BOOK THIS HOTEL AT ANY COST. NO MATTER KILLER DEALS YOU GET. ITS WORSE THAN A RAILWAY STATION OR PUBLIC TOILET. WE CAN STAY IN THE STATION BENCHES INSTEAD. DIRTY TOWELS, DIRTY WASHBASINS, DIRTY BEDSPREADS, WORST EXPERIENCE IN CHENNAI EVER
ID-2633	Well managed hotel, good wi-fi coverage, comfy mattresses and decent quality room, restaurant a little on the small side but you only spend minimal time in there. Overall a good quality 7 night stay.
ID-2634	very bad hotel though nearer to railway station. the ac's will run like a air cooler. there is no hot water service. the complimentary break fast is very very bad. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL AT ANY COST.
ID-2635	My room looked exactly like the picture. Over all, it is an excellent value for the money. I will definately revisit the Pearl. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are there to shop, ask the staff what auto prices range from one shopping area to another. I found their suggestions very helpful.
ID-2636	Hotel was good. but there was no good parking place nearby. food was affordable and very good.
ID-2637	"Decent hotel in the old part of the city. The area is noisy, so depending on the location of your room, you ll wake up earlier than expected in the morning.
The room was clean and staff was nice. But dont expect too much help from the travel agent in the lobby.

Breackfast was included, indian and some continental items.

We were a group of six foreigners and we spent two nights in the hotel.

It was just OK."
ID-2638	A good place to stay with all amenities. Service, location, the room and cleanliness was good and very well maintained. Beach and airport is also reachable from the hotel.
ID-2639	Hotel is located at a the Mount Rd. Which is the heart of chennai, many of the important places are very near thought like US consulate, Marina beach etc. Even though the first impression of the hotel won't meet your expectation. Stay is definitely the best you have for the within your budget.
ID-2640	I stayed in this Hotel Planet Mount with my family. The appearance of the hotel was good. The food quality of the hotel was good. The service of the hotel staff was very good. I will recommend this hotel to other travellers. The hotel room was very spacious, neat and comfortable and was provided with all amenities. The location was at the city centre and easy to find. Parking facility was average. There were no activities at the hotel.
ID-2641	Visited hotel for US visa purpose,the location of the hotel is convenient and appearance of the hotel was quite pleasing.The rooms should have been neater.The hotel is one of the economical options available.The staff is courteous.The hotel restaurant is average.The hotel rooms are cleaned everyday
ID-2642	I stayed there for a day and for the price I paid it was decent. Good and helpful staff, cleam rooms and bathrooms, food was good too. The location is good as it is in the arterial road of Chennai - Anna salai and had easy mode of transport from there. Decent stay.
ID-2643	I stay here for office work and find it is good budget hotel and nearby to many central places such as Mount road, T Nagar etc which are shopping places. Service and cleanliness is very good including food quality. Shall recommend to my friends. They provide other assistance such as taxi for site seeing and have good room facilities.
ID-2644	The hotel was good in overall services and facilities. The location of the hotel is convenient and appearance of the hotel was quite pleasing. The room allotted to me was spacious and maintained neatly with essential comforts. The food provided by the hotel was very nice in quality and taste. My stay was comfortable considering facilities and I would recommend this hotel to other travellers as well since the price is reasonable and is worth it.
ID-2645	Mall and commercial building beside the hotel
ID-2646	I would like to comment how pleased I was with the service provided to me and when I stayed in Planet Mount Hotel, Chennai. During my recent trip I was fortunate enough to stay at Planet Mount Hotel. The staffs are generally friendly and very helping. The rooms are very nice and clean, food is ok. If I visit next time in Chennai I will definitely go head with Planet Mount. Thank You Mathew Joy
ID-2647	It is very comfortable hotel to stay in planet mount .I felt very happy with my family and kids also.i suggest to my friends to stay in this hotel only.
ID-2648	Spacious and clean room. Food is very good and is reasonably priced. The resort is very quiet and pleasant with a lot of greenery. Lokesh from In Room Dining was good and prompt. Front desk staff and manager is very friendly. Best place to unwind near Chennai.
ID-2649	It was value for the money.. Had a pleasant stay there. It was pretty good a for that cost. The location was also good. My overall, stay was satisfactory. They provided us a good breakfast. The menu was also good.
ID-2650	Have't used much amenities as I was on official trip but had serious concerns with TV channels. Only regional channels or English channels were listed. Got bored but no other good hotel nearby and neither can experienced any change since last 2 years.

ID-2653	The hotel is located near to Queens Land Ponnamalle though the place is quite far from Chennai city, it is having a good conference and meeting hotel with a sizable capacity. The guest coming for the week end stay with kids can go to the next campus Queensland Theme park and near to the Hotel another theme park EVP is located. The hotel is very spacious and the guest can go for a comfortable walking in the evening.
ID-2654	The Pleasant Days hotel is located within city limits and reaching there is not a big issue. It has all the amenities of a good and decent hotel should have. The food is fine (south Indian especially). The centre of attraction is the queens land amusement park which is a must to visit. The hotel has a swimming pool and Wi-Fi facilities.
ID-2655	Resort located very outside of Chennai on Bangalore highway. A peaceful ambiance with the good. For cottage room Internal there is a scope for modernization. Apart from Swimming pool a scope for indoor games. Food quality is good but lot more North Indian food can be added.
ID-2656	This hotel stay was nice. It was a business trip. The rooms were neat and clean. The pillows and bedsheets were clean and good. The appearance of the hotel was good. The inside and outside look was good. It was near to the Chennai National Highway. The swimming pool was there and no other activity. I surely recommend this hotel to others. No suggestion for improvement and everything was good.
ID-2657	Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu, is located at the North east of the state. Apart from being a major district, this metropolis also serves as the gateway of South India. Chennai is a culturally developed city replete with centres of Carnatic Music and cultural events. My Favt. Food is Idly and vada.
ID-2658	nice place to spend time with family, excellent for family holiday
ID-2659	its fine to visit & staying providing good atmosphere really its gives me pleasant and peace full when i had stayed.
ID-2660	AC of the room was not working at 38 Degree Centigrade. Hotel staff was no even ready to acknowledge it. After a lot of persuasion my room was changed.

Staff helpful & courteous."
ID-2662	Reasonably priced, clean and comfortable. Helpful staff. Perfect location for early flight.

ID-2667	Good location. Walkable distance to good eateries including south indian food, dominos, petrol pump and atms
ID-2668	"Great value for money. I was a bit skeptical given that other options in the airport neighborhood were 2x more expensive compared to this place. However, I had a great experience and the value for money was exceptional.

I totally recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to pay the chain hotel prices but want to stay closer to airport."
ID-2669	"Friendly and helpful and honest hotel people.
Owner Mr. Selva a great and helpful man. Henry such a helpful and friendly guy."
ID-2670	 good location
ID-2671	Cheap hotel near Chennai airport, but the locality is not so good. The staff was good and helpful. There was no complimentary breakfast even though it was in the deal. The room was ok, no so good. But considering the cost it is ok. I struggled a little bit to find the place also no good restaurants nearby.
ID-2672	Excellent and worth it! Our stay at pp residency was memorable. The staff were humble and provided excellent room service. The food there was tasty and economical, even though I am from North India but the food caters to people across India and not just provide South Indian food.
ID-2673	It is a very nice place. Room is very peace, clean and very large. Food is very good. Staff is very co-operative mind. Car parking is very good for who are coming from outside. It is homely atmosphere. All type of food they can arrange for their guests.
ID-2674	There was no WiFi and TV connection available though it was mentioned all facilities are available while booking. No proper response from staffs too. AC was making lot of noise.
ID-2675	awesome stay..only set back was the wi-fi connection....was slow...
ID-2676	Excellent hotel. Will recommend to friends.
ID-2677	Reception delayed my check-in with so many formalities and slow at attending.Otherwise it is okay.
ID-2678	The stay was good but had to follow up multiple times for getting the room service. Even after calling 3 times I did not get the same.
ID-2679	Very bad staff, communicate with customers very root n shout...plz don't choose this hotel. Really worst and waste with that kind of tariff...even cheap 1 star hotel staffs are more discipline n respect customers very well... Plz clarify all of ur mistakes n try to do well otherwise it will become worst n worst until close ur business.
ID-2680	Hotel was comfortable.  Location sucked and I would not recommend Benzz Park.
ID-2681	very comfortable/ nice breakfast spread/good ambience
ID-2682	The food quality is not par with the charges they levy, it is quite expensive but quality is average.
ID-2683	enjoyed the stay without any major issues which will set off our mood
ID-2684	The so-called hotel is actually a service apartment. THE ROOM ALLOTED TO US WAS SO SMALL THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MOVE AROUND THE BED. THERE WAS NO PROVISION TO MAKE TEA/COFFEE IN THE ROOM. THE APPROACH TO THE APARTMENT AND THE SO-CALLED RECEPTION AREA (!) DO NOT GIVE A WELCOME APPEARENCE AND NEED A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT.
ID-2685	"The food service was very good. However the lift would never come to the ground floor, we needed to ask someone to get it switched on.
facilities in the room were basic- wifi too slow and weak, television with limited channels, the common corridor was full of mosquitoes. unable to call guests for a short discussion.

The service staff are very flexible with check in and out times."
ID-2686	The appearance of the hotel was good. The allotted room was good in the hotel. The service of the hotel was good. All amenities were available in working condition in the room. The restaurant was available in the hotel. I was satisfied with this hotel service.
ID-2687	Its in heart of Chennai very easily reachable to different offices from here. Cheap and best. Staff are very good. You can enjoy staying here. Besant nagar beach is in walkable distance from here so you can also enjoy the leisure period here.
ID-2688	 average stay
ID-2689	There is a polite response from room boy and Manager. Each and every one take care of the customers. No words can evaluate this hotel. There a peaceful location for accommodation. I have stayed in last one year, it will be perfect than other hotels.
ID-2690	The hotel is very nice and the tariff is also affordable. WiFi has good speed, only thing is that there is a temple nearby and they have a loudspeaker in front the hotel and there is a lot of noise it's very irritating. They play at wrong times sometimes late night it just disturbs a lot.
ID-2691	Though the location of the hotel is a congested one, the rooms were neat & clean. Rooms were good though pretty small. Tariff is too high- Single Ac more than 1500 for such features. Very small car parking for just 1 or 2 cars. Car parking should be developed & rates should be lowered to make more guests like this hotel. Also there is one or no service boys at times.
ID-2692	Hotel is good with AC and WiFi. Staff in the hotel are very cooperative but food served in the hotel was not good. They don't have their own restaurant, they brought it from somewhere nearby. Location wise its near to Marina Beach. Finding the hotel is a bit difficult as the landmark nearby is not sufficient. Average hotel for average price.
ID-2693	Courteous front office staff,room service was quick and fast,overall good staff behaviour..
ID-2694	Average stay
ID-2695	overall a pleasant stay
ID-2696	This is the only nearest Hotel from airport, This was my 3rd visit to hotel, maintenance is very poor they never improved till now. Food is better there & they provide a complimentary Airport drop. Hope they improve the cleanliness & service as early as possible
ID-2697	Bathrooms are very poor needs upgrade and cleanliness should be improved. Towels must be more better and they must manage to keep mosquitoes away. Overall room interior was too poor against the base rate they charge. They need to improve their breakfast menu. Too small only one fruit and juice is too less.
ID-2698	I stayed one night in Hotel Mount Manor because this hotel is near airport, this hotel perfect for 1 or 2 night stay for singles, hotel having pick and drop facility from airport. Food was not good and tasty break fast is good, lot of improvement required in food. Staff so good and service so good.
ID-2699	Mosquitoes, smelly, no hot water, the blankets seem to be somebody used it already used, with hairs and marks on them, it was a bizarre night for use when we arrived at 9PM, to leave by 3am for an early morning flight, it is a good experience not get carried away when makemytrip advertises it as 3star hotel, and with nice pictures.
ID-2700	Not a good VALUE for money. Will not prefer it again. Location is OK but other facilities are below expectations. Congested rooms, low quality of food, even while checking out, it took 30 minutes to clear food bills. Could be better maintained.
ID-2701	Very bad maintenance, especially bathroom was stinking. Beds were not clean. Not at all worth for 2400 rs. Very congested rooms and reception was also equally bad. Not concerned on service. No complementary water bottles also. Not drop to airport is the good thing about this hotel.
ID-2702	Great location but facilities not up to expectations. AC not working washroom and shower lacking in quality and cleanliness the service desk not prompt in acknowledging booking. Overall cleanliness and hygiene lacking no clarity on airport drop not value for the money charged.
ID-2703	Stayed here twice since, we had done a bundle booking on makemytrip. Bad service, we had asked for pick-up and both the times in spite of constant reminders the drivers failed to show up in time if this is what they mean by "FREE" they should not advertise it.
ID-2704	It was a decent hotel and which is near to airport. The airport drop service has good. Rooms are not so clean but its okay to manage for a one day stay and good service. The staff are good supportive and helpful. Overall its worth for the money.
ID-2705	Rooms allotted to me in this hotel was poor quality unhygenic. Air conditioning system noisy and poorly maintained that's why unable to sleep in the night. I am requesting make my trip do not advise this hotel to any of your site users. Lodge and guest houses are better than this hotel ...
ID-2706	Good and comfortable stay good service courteous staff. Print pickup from airport good food. Nice. Strongly recommend good budget hotel Nice stay. Will visit again if I stay in Chennai will stay at manor
ID-2707	Hotel location is good, it's very near to airport, airport pickup & drop facility gives invitation to come again & again. It's a great gesture by the hotel. Staff is very cooperative & food quality was very good. I will try to stay in this property in future also.
